4. **Interference Resistance** - Does learning new payload damage old?

**Personalized Pacing:**

- Fast learners (high retention): compress payloads, overlap deeply
- Slow learners (low retention): extend contact time, reduce overlap
- Damaged memory (trauma/disorder): micro-payloads, massive repetition

**No Fixed Timeline:**

1. Derive all content from axioms without reference
2. Solve novel problems using payload mechanics
3. Teach payload to another student coherently

Progress measured in **payload completion**, not **time spent**.
