# Hex Lattice Search — Specification v1.0

**O(1) Data Retrieval Through Deterministic Geometric Calculation on a Tri-Wing Hexagonal Lattice**

---

## Abstract

We present Hex Lattice Search, a data indexing and retrieval system that replaces traversal-based searching with closed-form geometric calculation. Data items are assigned sequential integer indices as they are created. Each index maps deterministically to a unique position in a tri-wing hexagonal lattice through pure arithmetic. Retrieval is O(1) regardless of dataset size — the position is calculated, never searched for. The lattice is append-only: new items are added at the next index, and the insertion sequence itself serves as a global clock. Every node's edge state, version, and relationship to every other node is computable from two integers — the node's index and the current lattice size. The system stores only key-value pairs (10 bytes per cell). Position, ring depth, wing assignment, neighbor addresses, edge orientations, version history, and integrity checksums are all derived from the index at zero storage cost. The lattice supports time-travel queries (view the dataset as it existed at any past insertion step) without snapshots, copies, or version tables. Capacity is N = 3M² where M is the wing radius, scalable by increasing M with no rehashing and no data migration.

## 1. The Lattice Geometry

### 1.1 Structure

The Hex Lattice is a hexagonal grid divided into three equal sectors (wings) at 120° intervals. There is one cell at the center. Successive rings surround the center. Ring K contains 6K cells. The three wings are labeled α (wing 0), β (wing 1), and γ (wing 2).

```
           γ (wing 2)
          / \
         /   \
        /     \
       /       \
      /    ·    \         · = center cell (index 0)
      \         /
       \       /
        \     /
    α    \   /    β
 (wing 0) \ / (wing 1)
```

M is the wing radius — the number of rings from center to the outer edge of each wing. Each wing is a triangular sector containing M² cells. Total lattice capacity:

```
N = 3M²
```

At M=1: N=3. At M=10: N=300. At M=100: N=30,000. At M=1000: N=3,000,000. At M=1,000,000: N=3,000,000,000,000 (3 trillion cells).

### 1.2 Ring Structure

```
Ring 0:  1 cell (center)
Ring 1:  6 cells
Ring 2:  12 cells
Ring 3:  18 cells
Ring K:  6K cells

Cumulative through ring R: 1 + 6(1 + 2 + ... + R) = 3R² + 3R + 1
```

Cells within each ring are distributed evenly across the three wings. Ring K contributes 2K cells to each wing.

### 1.3 Basis Vectors

The three wings are oriented at 120° intervals. Each wing has a basis vector:

```
u_α = (1, 0)                          wing 0: east
u_β = (-1/2, √3/2)                    wing 1: 120° from east
u_γ = (-1/2, -√3/2)                   wing 2: 240° from east
```

In VFR integer arithmetic at F=1024:

```
u_α = (1024, 0)
u_β = (-512, 887)                     887 ≈ 1024 × √3/2
u_γ = (-512, -887)
```

The remainder from the √3/2 approximation is carried in the VFR R value, preserving exactness.

---

## 2. Index-to-Position Mapping

### 2.1 The Formula

Given a cell index I (integer, 0 to N-1), compute its lattice position in O(1):

**Step 1: Ring depth**

```
R = ⌈(3 + √(12I - 3)) / 6⌉
```

For I=0 (center), R=0. For I=1 through I=6, R=1. The formula inverts the cumulative ring count.

**Step 2: Wing assignment**

```
W = I mod 3
```

Wing 0 (α): indices 0, 3, 6, 9, ...
Wing 1 (β): indices 1, 4, 7, 10, ...
Wing 2 (γ): indices 2, 5, 8, 11, ...

Consecutive indices interleave across wings, distributing data evenly.

**Step 3: Position within ring**

```
ring_start = 3R² - 3R + 1           (first index in ring R)
position_in_ring = I - ring_start
local_index = position_in_ring / 3    (position within this wing's portion of ring R)
```

**Step 4: Spatial coordinates**

```
P = R × u_W + local_offset(local_index, R, W)
```

The local offset distributes cells along the wing's arc of ring R. For a cell at local index L in wing W at ring R:

```
; Fractional position along the wing's arc
arc_fraction = L / (2R)    ; each wing has 2R cells in ring R

; Interpolate between wing basis vector and the next wing's basis vector
P.x = R × ((1 - arc_fraction) × u_W.x + arc_fraction × u_next_W.x)
P.y = R × ((1 - arc_fraction) × u_W.y + arc_fraction × u_next_W.y)
```

### 2.2 Integer Implementation

```
fn indexToPosition(I: i32) struct { x: i32, y: i32, ring: i32, wing: i32 } {
    if (I == 0) return .{ .x = 0, .y = 0, .ring = 0, .wing = 0 };

    // Step 1: Ring depth
    // R = ceil((3 + sqrt(12*I - 3)) / 6)
    const temp = 12 * I - 3;
    const sqrt_temp = isqrt(temp);
    const R = (3 + sqrt_temp + 5) / 6;    // +5 for ceiling with /6

    // Step 2: Wing
    const W = @mod(I, 3);

    // Step 3: Position in ring
    const ring_start = 3 * R * R - 3 * R + 1;
    const pos_in_ring = I - ring_start;
    const local_index = pos_in_ring / 3;

    // Step 4: Coordinates (fixed-point, F=1024)
    const cells_per_wing = 2 * R;
    const arc_num = local_index;
    const arc_den = cells_per_wing;

    // Basis vectors at F=1024
    const ux = [3]i32{ 1024, -512, -512 };
    const uy = [3]i32{ 0, 887, -887 };
    const next_W = (W + 1) % 3;

    // Interpolate
    const x = R * ((arc_den - arc_num) * ux[W] + arc_num * ux[next_W]) / arc_den;
    const y = R * ((arc_den - arc_num) * uy[W] + arc_num * uy[next_W]) / arc_den;

    return .{ .x = x, .y = y, .ring = R, .wing = W };
}
```

Operations: 1 multiply, 1 subtract, 1 integer square root (3 Newton iterations = 6 multiplies + 3 adds + 3 shifts), 1 divide (reciprocal multiply), 1 modulo, 4 multiplies for coordinates. Total: approximately 20 integer operations. On a VFR core at 150 MHz: ~130 nanoseconds. On ARM at 667 MHz: ~30 nanoseconds.

### 2.3 Integer Square Root

Newton's method for integer square root:

```
fn isqrt(n: i32) i32 {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    var guess: i32 = n;

    // Initial guess: highest bit / 2
    var shift: u5 = 0;
    var temp = n;
    while (temp > 0) : (shift += 1) { temp >>= 1; }
    guess = @as(i32, 1) << (shift / 2);

    // Newton iterations (3 is sufficient for 32-bit)
    guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2;
    guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2;
    guess = (guess + n / guess) / 2;

    // Floor correction
    if (guess * guess > n) guess -= 1;

    return guess;
}
```

Three iterations gives exact integer square root for all 32-bit inputs. Each iteration is one divide (reciprocal multiply on VFR hardware), one add, one shift.

## 3. Position-to-Index Mapping (Inverse)

### 3.1 The Formula

Given spatial coordinates (x, y), compute the cell index in O(1):

**Step 1: Ring depth from distance**

```
distance_squared = x² + y²
R = isqrt(distance_squared) / scale_factor
; quantize to nearest ring
```

**Step 2: Wing from angle**

```
; Determine which 120° sector the point falls in
if y >= 0 and x >= 0:                              W = 0  (α)
elif y >= 0 and x < 0 and |y| >= |x| × √3:        W = 1  (β, computed via integer comparison)
elif y < 0 and x < 0 and |y| >= |x| × √3:          W = 2  (γ)
; ... complete sector determination via integer comparisons

; Integer test for sector: compare y × 1024 against x × 887
; avoids √3 entirely
```

**Step 3: Local index from arc position**

```
; Project onto wing arc
; Compute fractional position along the arc
; Convert to local index
local_index = compute_arc_position(x, y, R, W)
```

**Step 4: Global index**

```
ring_start = 3R² - 3R + 1
I = ring_start + local_index × 3 + W
```

Same O(1) cost as forward mapping. Pure integer arithmetic.

### 3.2 Verification

Given an index I, compute position P. Given P, compute index I'. If I == I', the mappings are consistent. This round-trip verification is O(1) and can serve as an integrity check on every access.

---

## 4. Cell Data: Sides A and B

### 4.1 Structure

Every hex cell has two sides. Side A stores the key. Side B stores the value. Both are VFR pairs.

```
Cell at index I:
  Side A: [key:   i32, key_meta:   i8]     5 bytes
  Side B: [value: i32, value_meta: i8]     5 bytes
  Total:  10 bytes per cell
```

The key is what you search for. The value is what you retrieve. The lattice position connects them — you compute the position from the key (via hashing to an index), read side A to confirm the key matches, read side B to get the value.

### 4.2 Key Hashing

To store an arbitrary key in the lattice, hash the key to an index:

```
I = hash(key) mod N
```

Then store at position I:

```
side_A = key (or key hash for collision verification)
side_B = value
```

To retrieve:

```
I = hash(key) mod N
position = indexToPosition(I)
cell = lattice[position]
if cell.side_a == key:
    return cell.side_b     ; hit
else:
    ; collision — use wing-based probing (see Section 4.3)
```

### 4.3 Collision Resolution via Wing Probing

When two keys hash to the same index, the hex geometry provides a natural probing sequence. Instead of linear probing or chaining, probe along the wing:

```
Probe sequence for index I in wing W, ring R:

Probe 0: I                              (original position)
Probe 1: I + 3                          (next position in same wing, same ring)
Probe 2: I + 6                          (two positions ahead in same wing)
Probe 3: I + 6R                         (jump to next ring, same wing)
Probe 4: I + 6R + 3                     (next ring, one position ahead)
```

Each probe is computed from the original index by addition. No pointer chasing. No linked list traversal. The probing stays within the same wing, preserving spatial locality and cache coherence.

With a load factor of 50-70% (typical for open addressing), most lookups require 1-2 probes. The expected cost is O(1) with a small constant.

### 4.4 Side Metadata

The i8 metadata byte in each side carries per-cell information:

```
Side A metadata (key_meta):
  bits 0-2:  collision chain length (0 = no collision, 1-7 = probe depth)
  bits 3-4:  key type (0 = integer, 1 = hash, 2 = composite, 3 = reserved)
  bits 5-7:  reserved

Side B metadata (value_meta):
  bits 0-3:  value type tag
  bits 4-7:  user-defined flags
```

The collision chain length in key_meta tells the retrieval code how many probes to check before concluding the key is absent. This bounds the worst-case lookup cost.

---

## 5. The Append Clock

### 5.1 Insertion Order Is the Clock

The lattice is append-only. Cells are added in sequence: index 0, then 1, then 2, and so on. The current lattice size N represents the current time. Node I was created at time I. No separate timestamp field is stored. The index IS the timestamp.

```
Current time:           T = N (number of cells in lattice)
Creation time of cell I: T_created = I
Age of cell I:          age = N - I
```

### 5.2 Edge State from the Clock

Every insertion advances the global clock by one. Each hex cell has edges connecting to its neighbors. The edge orientation of cell I when the lattice contains N nodes is:

```
edge_state(I, N) = (N - I) mod 6
```

This is computable from two integers. No storage. No updates. No propagation. When a new node is added (N becomes N+1), every existing node's edge state implicitly advances by one. But nothing is written. The formula produces the new state from the new N.

The six possible edge states correspond to the six edges of the hexagonal cell. The current edge state indicates which edge is "active" or "leading" at this moment in the lattice's history.

### 5.3 Dipole Orientations

Each hex cell contains three internal dipoles at 120° intervals, aligned with the three wings. The orientation of dipole K (0, 1, 2) in cell I at lattice size N:

```
dipole_state(I, K, N) = ((N - I) × 2 + K × 2) mod 6
```

Three dipoles × six orientations = 18 possible combined states per cell, all computable from I, K, and N. Uses:

**Integrity checksum:** The three dipole states form a 3-value tuple that is unique to the combination of I and N. If stored data claims to be at index I but the computed dipole states don't match, the data is corrupt or misplaced.

```
expected = dipole_states(I, current_N)
actual = stored_dipole_hint  ; optional 1-byte field
if expected != actual: data_integrity_error
```

**Routing:** The dipole pointing toward wing W indicates the nearest neighbor in that wing's direction. Following dipole orientations traces a path through the lattice without consulting a neighbor table.

**Load distribution:** At time N, cell I's leading dipole points toward wing `(N - I) mod 3`. This deterministically distributes cells across wings over time, balancing work assignment without coordination.

---

## 6. Time-Travel Queries

### 6.1 View the Past

The lattice at time T (when it contained T cells) is simply the first T cells of the current lattice:

```
query(key, at_time=T):
    I = hash(key) mod T         ; note: mod T, not mod N
    if I >= T: return NOT_FOUND  ; didn't exist yet
    position = indexToPosition(I)
    cell = lattice[position]
    if cell.side_a == key:
        return cell.side_b
    else:
        ; probe, but only within indices < T
```

No snapshots. No copy-on-write. No version tables. The lattice at time T is the first T cells. Everything after T is invisible to the query. The formula is the same — only the modulus and bounds check change.

### 6.2 Supersession

When data is corrected or updated, the old cell remains. A new cell is appended with the updated value:

```
Time 500:  cell 500 stores key=42, value=100
Time 8000: cell 8000 stores key=42, value=200  (correction)

Query at T=600:   hash(42) mod 600  → finds cell 500 → returns 100
Query at T=9000:  hash(42) mod 9000 → finds cell 8000 → returns 200
Query at T=700:   hash(42) mod 700  → finds cell 500 → returns 100
```

The most recent cell for a given key is the highest-index cell with that key within the query's time window. For the current time (T=N), the latest value is always found because the hash modulus includes all cells.

### 6.3 Supersession Chains

When a key is updated multiple times, the cells form a supersession chain ordered by index. Finding the latest version at time T:

```
latest_for_key(key, T):
    ; Start from the most recent possible position
    I = hash(key) mod T
    
    ; Walk backward through collision probes if needed
    ; The highest-index cell matching this key within T is the current version
    
    ; For fast latest-version lookup: side_a metadata can store
    ; the index of the next version (if known at append time)
    ; or: the query scans from the high end down
```

For frequently updated keys, an optimization: when appending a new version, store the previous version's index in the new cell's metadata. This creates a backward chain that the query can follow without scanning.

---

## 7. Lattice Scaling

### 7.1 Growing the Lattice

When the lattice fills (N approaches 3M²), increase M:

```
Old capacity: N_old = 3 × M_old²
New capacity: N_new = 3 × M_new²   where M_new = M_old + 1
New cells:    N_new - N_old = 3 × (2 × M_old + 1)
```

Existing cells do not move. Their indices and positions remain the same. The new ring adds cells at the periphery. The index-to-position formula works for all indices in the expanded lattice.

No rehashing. No data migration. No rebalancing. Growth is adding empty cells at the edges.

### 7.2 Load Factor Management

```
load_factor = active_cells / total_cells

Optimal: 50-70% for open addressing
If load_factor > 70%: grow M by 1 (adds one ring)
If load_factor < 20% and M > 1: shrink M by 1 (remove outer ring)
```

Shrinking removes only the outermost ring. If any cells in that ring contain data, they must be reinserted into the smaller lattice before shrinking. This is the only operation that moves data.

### 7.3 Capacity Planning

```
Wing radius M    Total cells N    Storage at 10 bytes/cell
1                3                30 bytes
10               300              3 KB
100              30,000           293 KB
1,000            3,000,000        29 MB
10,000           300,000,000      2.8 GB
100,000          30,000,000,000   279 GB
```

M=1000 provides 3 million cells in 29 MB. Sufficient for most game knowledge bases, entity indexes, and SVDAG node pools.

---

## 8. Neighbor Computation

### 8.1 Direct Neighbors

Every cell has up to 6 neighbors in the hex grid. The neighbors of cell I are computable from I, R, and W:

```
fn neighbors(I: i32, M: i32) [6]i32 {
    const pos = indexToPosition(I);
    const R = pos.ring;
    const W = pos.wing;

    var result: [6]i32 = undefined;

    ; Same ring, adjacent in wing
    result[0] = I + 3;                    ; next in same wing
    result[1] = I - 3;                    ; previous in same wing

    ; Inner ring (R-1)
    result[2] = innerRingNeighbor(I, R, W, 0);
    result[3] = innerRingNeighbor(I, R, W, 1);

    ; Outer ring (R+1)
    result[4] = outerRingNeighbor(I, R, W, 0);
    result[5] = outerRingNeighbor(I, R, W, 1);

    ; Clamp to valid range
    for (&result) |*n| {
        if (n.* < 0 or n.* >= 3 * M * M) n.* = -1;  ; invalid
    }

    return result;
}
```

No neighbor table stored. All computed. O(1) per neighbor lookup.

### 8.2 Wing Neighbors

Each cell's wing assignment (W = I mod 3) determines which of the three processing partitions it belongs to. The wing neighbors are cells with the same W value in adjacent rings:

```
wing_neighbor_inner = I - 6R + 3    ; same wing, one ring inward
wing_neighbor_outer = I + 6R + 3    ; same wing, one ring outward
```

These are useful for hierarchical queries: search the current ring first, then expand to adjacent rings. The wing structure means expansion is directional (along the wing's axis) rather than radial (in all directions equally).

---

## 9. VFR Batch Format

### 9.1 Lattice as Batch

The hex lattice stores in DDR3 as a standard VFR batch:

```
Hex Lattice batch:
[F=lattice_id, count=N, depth=2]

Each cell (10 bytes):
  [key:   i32, key_meta:   i8]    side A
  [value: i32, value_meta: i8]    side B
```

F identifies which lattice this is (a system may have multiple lattices for different purposes). Count is the current number of cells. Depth is always 2 (two sides per cell).

### 9.2 Lattice Metadata

A separate small batch stores lattice configuration:

```
Lattice metadata:
[F=lattice_meta, count=1, depth=4]

  [M:              i32, 0]    pair 0: wing radius
  [N:              i32, 0]    pair 1: current cell count (= clock)
  [load_factor:    i32, 0]    pair 2: active cells (for load monitoring)
  [hash_seed:      i32, 0]    pair 3: hash function seed
```

### 9.3 Operations as Batch Transforms

**Lookup:** ARM computes position from key hash, reads cell from DDR3. O(1). No FPGA needed for single lookups.

**Bulk lookup:** Batch of keys → batch of positions (computed) → batch of values (gathered from lattice). FPGA computes positions for all keys in parallel, then gathers values.

```
Input:  [F=query, count=1000, depth=1]   (batch of keys)
Output: [F=result, count=1000, depth=2]  (batch of key-value pairs)
```

Each FPGA core computes positions for its portion of the key batch. 30 cores processing 1000 lookups: 33 lookups per core × 20 operations × 150 MHz = 4.4 microseconds for 1000 lookups.

**Bulk insert:** Batch of new key-value pairs appended to the lattice. Each pair gets the next sequential index. The ARM writes the new cells to DDR3 and increments N. No FPGA needed for insertion (it's sequential writes).

**Bulk filter:** "Find all cells where value satisfies predicate P" is a batch scan over the lattice. FPGA cores each scan a portion. This IS Prolog evaluation — filtering the fact batch. O(N/cores) time.

### 12.1 Zig Structure

```zig
const HexCell = packed struct {
    key: i32,
    key_meta: i8,
    value: i32,
    value_meta: i8,
};

const HexLattice = struct {
    cells: []HexCell,
    M: i32,               // wing radius
    N: i32,               // current cell count (clock)
    capacity: i32,         // 3 * M * M
    hash_seed: i32,

    fn init(allocator: std.mem.Allocator, M: i32) !HexLattice {
        const capacity = 3 * M * M;
        const cells = try allocator.alloc(HexCell, @intCast(capacity));
        @memset(std.mem.sliceAsBytes(cells), 0);
        return .{
            .cells = cells,

        };
    }

    fn insert(self: *HexLattice, key: i32, value: i32) !i32 {
        if (self.N >= self.capacity) return error.LatticeFull;
        const I = self.N;

        const cell = self.cells[@intCast(I)];
        if (cell.key == key) return cell.value;

        // Wing-directed probing
        var probe: i32 = 1;
        while (probe < 8) : (probe += 1) {

            const probe_cell = self.cells[@intCast(probe_I)];
            if (probe_cell.key == key) return probe_cell.value;
            if (probe_cell.key == 0 and probe_cell.value == 0) return null;
        }
        return null;
    }

    fn lookupAtTime(self: *const HexLattice, key: i32, T: i32) ?i32 {
        if (T <= 0) return null;
        const effective_N = @min(T, self.N);

    fn edgeState(self: *const HexLattice, I: i32) i32 {
        return @mod(self.N - I, 6);

}
```

### 12.2 VFR Batch Operations

```zig
fn bulkLookup(
    lattice: *const HexLattice,
    keys: []const i32,
    results: []i32,
) void {
    // Each key: compute hash, compute position, read cell
    for (keys, 0..) |key, i| {
        results[i] = lattice.lookup(key) orelse -1;
    }
}

fn bulkInsert(
    lattice: *HexLattice,
    keys: []const i32,
    values: []const i32,
) !void {
    for (keys, 0..) |key, i| {
        _ = try lattice.insert(key, values[i]);
    }
}
```

On FPGA, bulkLookup is parallelized across cores. Each core processes a portion of the key batch. The position computation (20 integer ops) runs on VFR ALU. The cell read is a DDR3 access at the computed offset. 30 cores processing 30,000 lookups: 1,000 per core × 20 ops ÷ 150 MHz = 133 microseconds.

## 13. Applications

### 13.1 Prolog Knowledge Base Index

The KB stores facts in the hex lattice. Predicate ID + argument hash → cell index. Side A holds the key (predicate + args hash). Side B holds the fact data (or a pointer to a deeper batch for multi-argument facts). Lookup is O(1). Time-travel queries use lookupAtTime to see the KB as it existed at any past frame.

### 13.2 SVDAG Node Pool Index

SVDAG nodes are stored in the lattice. The node's spatial hash (from its octree position) → cell index. Side A holds the octree coordinate hash. Side B holds the child_mask + child_offset. Beam-casting drills the SVDAG by computing lattice positions from octree coordinates — no pointer chasing through the node tree.

### 13.3 Entity Spatial Index

Entity positions are stored in the lattice with their spatial coordinates hashed to cell indices. Neighbor queries use the hex lattice's computed neighbor function — given the cell for entity A, compute the 6 adjacent cells and check for entities there. Spatial queries cost O(1) per neighbor check, O(K) for K neighbors.

### 13.4 Network Session Index

Active network sessions are stored in the lattice. Session ID → cell index. Side A holds the session ID. Side B holds the connection state. The insertion index IS the creation timestamp. Session age is N - I. No separate session tracking structure needed.
