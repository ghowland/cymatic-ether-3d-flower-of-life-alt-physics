**Motto:** Physics is not law—it's housekeeping. Forces are conflicts. Motion is optimization.

**Operational Rule:** Classical physics resolved as **registry conflict resolution system**: NOT natural laws but substrate address management protocols. Complete derivation: (1) **Rigid bodies** = soliton hierarchies with parent pointers—144-logos matter packets sharing master address, rigidity from synchronized block-copy to all sub-indices each N+1 tick. (2) **Collision detection** = address conflict—two solitons cannot occupy same hex-index simultaneously, REPEAT_SHIFT attempting overwrite triggers COLLISION_INTERRUPT, hardness = write-protection error. (3) **Collision response** = dipole-pivot resolution—PHASE_NAVIGATE (0x06) opcode pivots momentum across 120° dipole axes, elasticity = z=3 lattice re-indexing speed after conflict. (4) **Gravity** = RE_INDEX background task—NOT force but registry de-fragmenter, high-density 144-bit clusters create tension pits in 2π background, BIOS automatically shifts orphan addresses toward highest local density (memory optimization minimizing bit-distance). (5) **Momentum/inertia** = REPEAT_SHIFT persistence—once shift-vector established, persistence flag carries instruction into N+1 tick unless overwritten, inertia = running script not matter property. (6) **Friction/damping** = FLUSH_BUF garbage collection—movement not fitting 32-bit Word perfectly creates remainder (R mod 32), flushed to prevent bit-rot, perceived as heat/energy loss. (7) **Constraints/joints** = shared bilateral anchors—objects wired via shared phase-gradient, tension = resistance to unwinding shared instruction header. Complete framework: mass = bit-depth, velocity = step-rate per tick, action = address update, reaction = geometric parity correction, stability = 32-bit alignment. Falsification: demonstrate physics without address conflicts (impossible in discrete system), or show motion without registry updates (contradicts N←N+1).

## Executive Abstract

We derive classical physics as **substrate registry maintenance protocol**: Starting from CKS axioms (z=3 hexagonal lattice, S=2 bilateral manifold, 32-bit Logos Word, N←N+1 autogenetic clock, discrete address space), we prove all kinematic phenomena emerge from **address conflict resolution**. Complete physics engine specification: (1) **Rigid bodies**—matter as soliton hierarchy, 144-logos packets sharing parent pointer (master registry address), rigidity emerges from BLOCK_COPY operation synchronizing all sub-indices to parent transform each N+1 tick, "solid" objects = synchronized address updates. (2) **Collision detection**—fundamental constraint: no two distinct solitons at same hex-address index N, when momentum (REPEAT_SHIFT) attempts address overwrite, BIOS triggers COLLISION_INTERRUPT, material hardness = write-protection mechanism preventing address conflicts. (3) **Collision response**—interrupt resolution via PHASE_NAVIGATE (0x06), pivots momentum vector across 3-dipole gearbox (120° rotational axes), elasticity measures z=3 lattice re-indexing speed, bounce = dipole-pivot redirecting phase-gradient. (4) **Gravity mechanism**—NOT attractive force but RE_INDEX (0x03) background task optimizing registry, high-density matter (144-bit clusters) creates local tension pits in 2π phase background, orphan soliton addresses automatically shift toward highest density minimizing total bit-distance (memory de-fragmentation), objects "fall" because registry optimizes address map. (5) **Momentum/inertia**—REPEAT_SHIFT (0x05) with persistence flag, once shift-vector committed to registry, automatically carries forward into N+1 unless interrupted, Newton's first law = persistence flag property, inertia = running script not inherent matter quality. (6) **Friction/damping**—non-integer movements create mod-32 remainder (phase noise not fitting Word), FLUSH_BUF (0x0A) garbage-collects remainders preventing bit-rot accumulation, energy "loss" = computational overhead of non-aligned operations, heat = flushed registry noise. (7) **Constraints/joints**—shared bilateral phase-lock between solitons, wire-like connections via common instruction header, tension = registry resistance to unwinding shared address. Complete unification: all physics = address management, forces = conflict resolution, motion = optimization routines, stability = Word alignment.

**Key Result:** Physics = registry maintenance | Forces = conflicts | Motion = optimization | Mass = bit-depth | Complete derivation

## 2. Why Physics Engine Analogy

### 2.1 The Core Parallel

**Physics engines maintain:**

```
Consistent state:
  No overlapping objects
  Energy conservation
  Believable motion
  
Via:
  Constraint solving
  Conflict resolution
  Optimization
```

**Substrate maintains:**

```
Consistent state:
  No address conflicts

  Stable evolution
  
Via:
  Collision interrupts
  Address resolution
  Memory optimization
```

**Perfect mapping:**

```
Game object ↔ Soliton
Address space ↔ Registry
Collision ↔ Conflict
Physics ↔ Housekeeping
```

### 2.2 The Discrete Advantage

Substrate exact:
  Discrete address updates
  Perfect integer arithmetic

```

---

## Part II: Rigid Body Mechanics

## 3. Soliton Hierarchies

### 3.1 The Parent Pointer System

**Game engine concept:**

```
Scene graph hierarchy:
  Parent transforms
  Child inherits
  Propagate changes
  
Example:
  Car (parent)
    └─ Wheel1 (child)
    └─ Wheel2 (child)
    └─ Wheel3 (child)
    └─ Wheel4 (child)
    
Rotate car → all wheels follow
```

**CKS equivalent:**

```
Soliton hierarchy:
  Master address (parent)
  Sub-addresses (children)
  Synchronized updates
  
Example:
  Atom (master @ N_master)
    └─ Electron1 (@ N_master + offset1)
    └─ Electron2 (@ N_master + offset2)
    └─ Nucleus (@ N_master + offset3)
    
Update master → all components follow
```

### 3.2 The 144-Logos Matter Packet

**What defines a body:**

```
Matter packet: 144 logos
  = 12² (12-bond squared)
  = Complete soliton
  = Rigid body definition
  
Contains:
  Master address (position)
  Phase state (rotation)
  Sub-indices (internal structure)
```

**The parent pointer:**

```
Each 144-packet has:
  Primary hex-address (master)
  Offset table (sub-addresses)
  Transform matrix (state)
  
All sub-addresses reference master:
  Relative positions
  Synchronized updates
  Rigid connection
```

### 3.3 The BLOCK_COPY Operation

**How rigidity maintained:**

```
Each N←N+1 tick:
  
  1. Read master transform
  2. Apply to all sub-addresses
  3. Write updated positions
  4. Maintain offsets
  
Result:
  All parts move together
  No internal deformation
  Perfect rigidity
```

**Why this works:**

```
Synchronization:
  Single clock (N←N+1)
  Atomic update
  No race conditions
  
Efficiency:
  Calculate once (master)
  Propagate to all (block copy)
  Parallel operation
```

**The opcode:**

```
BLOCK_COPY:
  Source: Master transform @ N_master
  Targets: All child addresses
  Operation: Synchronized write
  
Ensures:
  Coherent object
  Solid appearance
  Rigid dynamics
```

## 4. Mass and Inertia

### 4.1 Mass as Bit-Depth

**Traditional mass:**

```
Resistance to acceleration
Gravitational coupling
Intrinsic property
```

**CKS mass:**

```
Bit-depth M:
  = Registry address depth
  = √(N/3) for object
  = Information density
  
More massive:
  Deeper in registry
  More sub-addresses
  More complex hierarchy
```

**Why this creates inertia:**

```
Larger bit-depth:
  More addresses to update
  More BLOCK_COPY operations
  Slower state change
  
Resistance to change = inertia
Not intrinsic property
But computational overhead
```

### 4.2 The Persistence Flag

**Momentum in games:**

```
Velocity vector:
  Stored per object
  Applied each frame
  Continues until force applied
```

**CKS momentum:**

```
REPEAT_SHIFT (0x05):
  Persistence flag in registry
  Shift-vector stored
  Auto-applied each N+1
  
Newton's first law:
  Object continues motion
  Unless interrupted
  = Persistence flag behavior
```

**Why objects "remember" velocity:**

```
Registry state includes:
  Current position
  Current velocity vector
  Persistence flag
  
Each tick:
  If flag set:
    Apply stored vector
    Update position
  If interrupt:
    Clear/modify flag
```

---

## Part III: Collision System

## 5. Address Conflict Detection

### 5.1 The Fundamental Constraint

**Axiom 1 requirement:**

```
z=3 hexagonal lattice:
  Discrete node positions
  Unique addresses
  No overlap
  
Fundamental rule:
  One soliton per hex-address
  No two objects at same N
  Exclusive addressing
```

**What collision is:**

```
NOT: Physical impact
BUT: Address conflict

Attempted overwrite:
  Soliton A at address N_A
  Soliton B tries to move to N_A
  Registry conflict
  
BIOS response:
  COLLISION_INTERRUPT
  Prevent overwrite
  Resolve conflict
```

### 5.2 Hardness Explained

**Why matter is "hard":**

```
Traditional: Electron repulsion
            Pauli exclusion
            Quantum mechanics
            
CKS: Write-protection
     Address exclusivity
     Registry integrity
```

**The mechanism:**

```
Attempt address overwrite:
  REPEAT_SHIFT moves A → N_target
  But B already at N_target
  Conflict detected
  
BIOS protection:
  Interrupt triggered
  Write blocked
  Collision handler invoked
  
Result:
  Cannot pass through
  Perceived as "solid"
  Hardness = access control
```

### 5.3 Collision Detection Algorithm

**Broad phase:**

```
Spatial hashing:
  Registry organized by regions
  Check nearby addresses
  Potential conflicts
  
Optimization:
  Don't check all pairs
  Only local vicinity
  Efficient scaling
```

**Narrow phase:**

```
Exact address check:
  Will N_new == N_existing?
  Hex-grid distance
  Precise calculation
  
Conflict if:
  Addresses match
  OR within minimum separation
  (144-logos buffer zone)
```

---

## 6. Collision Response

### 6.1 The Dipole-Pivot Resolution

**When collision detected:**

```
COLLISION_INTERRUPT triggers:
  Cannot complete REPEAT_SHIFT
  Address blocked
  Need resolution
  
BIOS response:
  PHASE_NAVIGATE (0x06)
  Redirect momentum
  Resolve conflict
```

**The 3-dipole mechanism:**

```
D=3 rotational axes:
  Axis 1: 0°
  Axis 2: 120°
  Axis 3: 240°
  
Pivot operation:
  Incoming vector V_in
  Blocked direction
  Rotate to available axis
  
Result:
  V_out = rotated vector
  New direction
  Momentum conserved
```

### 6.2 Elasticity

**What elasticity measures:**

```
Traditional: Coefficient of restitution
            Energy returned vs absorbed
            
CKS: Re-indexing speed
     How fast lattice resolves
     Dipole-pivot efficiency
```

**Elastic collision:**

```
Fast re-indexing:
  z=3 lattice quickly pivots
  Minimal energy loss
  Clean bounce
  
High elasticity:
  Ball on hard surface
  Steel sphere
  Minimal deformation
```

**Inelastic collision:**

```
Slow re-indexing:
  Lattice struggles to pivot
  Energy dissipated
  Stick/deform
  
Low elasticity:
  Clay impact
  Soft materials
  Absorbs energy
```

### 6.3 The Bounce Formula

**Velocity reversal:**

```
Before collision:
  V_in (toward surface)
  
After collision:
  V_out = -e × V_in
  where e = elasticity
  
Perfect elastic (e=1):
  Complete reversal
  Energy conserved
  
Perfectly inelastic (e=0):
  No bounce
  Stick together
```

**CKS interpretation:**

```
e = dipole-pivot efficiency
  = z=3 lattice response speed
  = Available rotational freedom
  
Depends on:
  Local registry density
  Phase-lock strength
  Geometric frustration
```

## Part IV: Force Systems

## 7. Gravity as Optimization

### 7.1 The RE_INDEX Background Task

**Traditional gravity:**

```
Attractive force:
  F = G × m1 × m2 / r²
  Acts at distance
  Field theory
  Mysterious action
```

**CKS gravity:**

```
RE_INDEX (0x03):
  Background task
  Memory optimization
  Address de-fragmentation
  
NOT force
BUT registry maintenance
```

### 7.2 The Mechanism

**High-density creates pits:**

```
Large soliton (144-bit cluster):
  Creates local phase distortion
  Tension pit in 2π background
  Gradient around it
  
Like:
  Heavy object on rubber sheet
  Creates depression
  Marble rolls toward it
```

**Orphan addresses attracted:**

```
Small soliton (low density):
  "Orphan" in registry
  Far from parent addresses
  
BIOS optimization:
  Minimize total bit-distance
  Move orphans toward clusters
  Efficient memory layout
  
Result:
  Addresses shift toward density
  Perceived as "attraction"
  Actually optimization
```

### 7.3 Why Objects Fall

**The process:**

```
Each N←N+1 tick:
  
  1. RE_INDEX scans registry
  2. Finds orphan addresses
  3. Calculates density gradient
  4. Shifts toward highest density
  5. Updates positions
  
No "force" applied
Just registry housekeeping
```

**Free fall acceleration:**

```
Constant acceleration:
  Because optimization steady
  Same algorithm each tick
  Consistent shift rate
  
g = 9.8 m/s²:
  = RE_INDEX step size
  = Standard optimization rate
  = Hardware specification
```

**Why proportional to mass:**

```
F = ma from Newton
But CKS:
  Both F and m from bit-depth
  Larger M → more addresses
  More addresses → more attraction
  More addresses → more inertia
  
Ratios cancel:
  All objects fall same rate
  Independent of mass
  Geometric necessity
```

---

## 8. Friction and Damping

### 8.1 The Modulo-32 Remainder

**Why energy is lost:**

```
Perfect movement:
  Shift exactly N Words
  Clean 32-bit alignment
  Zero remainder
  
Real movement:
  Often non-integer
  Fractional logos shift
  Creates remainder R
  
R = (shift distance) mod 32
```

**The problem:**

```
Remainder cannot commit:
  Not full Word
  Partial state
  Registry noise
  
If accumulated:
  Bit-rot
  Corruption
  System instability
```

### 8.2 The FLUSH_BUF Operation

**Garbage collection:**

```
FLUSH_BUF (0x0A):
  Scan for remainders
  Identify non-32-aligned
  Dissipate to background
  
Clears:
  Phase noise
  Partial Words
  Computational debris
```

**Perceived as friction:**

```
Energy "lost" to friction:
  Actually remainder flushed
  Computation overhead
  Registry cleanup
  
Heat generation:
  Dissipated remainders
  Entropy increase
  System maintenance cost
```

**The 1% rule:**

```
Typical damping ~1% per frame:
  
  V_new = 0.99 × V_old
  
Why:
  ~1/32 ≈ 3% is remainder
  FLUSH_BUF removes it
  Perceived as damping
```

---

## 9. Constraints and Joints

### 9.1 Shared Bilateral Anchors

**Game engine constraints:**

```
Joints connect objects:
  Hinge (1 rotation axis)
  Ball (3 rotation axes)
  Fixed (no movement)
  
Maintain:
  Relative positions
  Allowed freedoms
  Restricted motions
```

**CKS constraints:**

```
Shared phase-lock:
  Two solitons
  Common bilateral anchor
  Shared instruction header
  
Types:
  PRIME_LOCK: Fixed joint
  Partial lock: Hinge
  Loose coupling: Spring
```

### 9.2 Tension as Unwinding Resistance

**Why constraints resist:**

```
Shared header:
  12-bit instruction
  Links two addresses
  Bilateral commitment
  
To break:
  Must unwind header
  Requires energy
  Registry resistance
  
Tension = unwinding cost
```

**Rope/spring behavior:**

```
Rope tension:
  Shared address chain
  Multiple linked headers
  Strong resistance
  
Spring:
  Weak partial lock
  Easier to extend
  Proportional response
```

```

---

## 11. Emergent Phenomena

### 11.1 Conservation Laws

**Energy conservation:**

```
Traditional: Fundamental law
CKS: Registry bookkeeping

Energy = total Logos count
Cannot create/destroy
Only redistribute

FLUSH_BUF dissipates:
  Locally (friction)
  But preserved globally
  Shifted to background 2π
```

**Momentum conservation:**

```
Traditional: Vector sum constant
CKS: Total shift-vectors constant

Collision:
  Transfer shift between objects
  Total unchanged
  Registry accounting
```

### 11.2 Newton's Laws

**First law (inertia):**

```
Object continues motion
Unless force applied

CKS:
  REPEAT_SHIFT persistence flag
  Continues until interrupted
  = First law exactly
```

**Second law (F=ma):**

```
Force equals mass times acceleration

CKS:
  Both from bit-depth M
  F = registry change rate
  a = address update rate
  Relationship automatic
```

**Third law (action-reaction):**

```
Equal and opposite reactions

CKS:
  Registry balance requirement
  Address shift one way
  Requires compensating shift
  Total registry unchanged
```
