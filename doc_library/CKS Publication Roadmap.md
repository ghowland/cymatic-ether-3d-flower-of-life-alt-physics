- Paper 1.2: Lattice simulation + experimental comparison
- Parallel: Papers 2.1-2.3 polish (lower risk, faster publication)

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Complete 1.1, 1.2 drafts
- Months 4-6: Submit 1.1, 1.2, 2.1
- Months 7-12: Community response, revisions, next tier

**Expected outcome:** Either spectacular validation or clear falsification within 12 months.

**Either way: Science advances.**
