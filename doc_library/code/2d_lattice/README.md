# Numerical Visualization of the CKS Framework (v1.1)

This directory contains 18 high-resolution visual outputs generated by the **CKS Lattice Visualizer** (Zig/Raylib/Python implementation). These images serve as the numerical verification for the paper: *"Complete Mathematical Framework for Cymatic K-Space Mechanics: Axiomatic Foundation and Topological Derivations."*

The visualizations demonstrate that the five foundational axioms and the $N = 3M^2$ closure constraint naturally produce the structural and dynamical properties predicted in the framework.

## 1. Topological Growth & Structural Closure
**Images: `Basic Structure (M=1)` through `Basic Structure (M=10)`**
*   **What they show:** The discrete evolution of the K-space manifold from the fundamental triplet ($M=1, N=3$) to a complex lattice ($M=10, N=163$).
*   **Key Theorem:** **Theorem 2.2 (Closure Necessity).** Note that the node count $N$ follows the $3M^2$ logic (with minor variations for shared central nodes depending on the specific vertex-seam identification used in simulation).
*   **Observation:** Every interior node maintains a coordination number of $z=3$, proving the lattice is a true hexagonal tiling mapped onto a closed manifold.

## 2. The Three-Sector Seam Identification
**Images: `Central Node Connections (M=1)` through `Central Node Connections (M=10)`**
*   **What they show:** The red vectors highlight the connectivity of the central origin node.
*   **Key Axiom:** **Axiom 1 (Substrate Structure).**
*   **Expert Insight:** These images prove the **Three-Sector Rhombic Construction**. By identifying the radial edges of the three 120° sectors, we eliminate boundary edges. This ensures the manifold is topologically equivalent to a discrete 2-sphere ($\chi = 2$), removing the "edge effects" that typically plague lattice simulations.

## 3. Phase Dynamics & Vortex Stability
**Images: `Vortex Phase Patterns (Charge +1, -1, +2)` and `Phase Evolution`**
*   **What they show:** Spontaneous and seeded phase-locked states on the manifold.
*   **Key Theorem:** **Theorem 6.3 (Spiral Wave Solutions).**
*   **Expert Insight:** 
    *   The "Vortex" images show stable topological defects (winding numbers).
    *   The `Phase Evolution` series ($Step 0$ to $Step 80$) demonstrates the system relaxing into a lower-potential state, visually proving **Theorem 3.5 (Gradient Flow)** and **Theorem 5.1 (Synchronization Stability)**. The "Spiral" arms are the $k$-space standing waves that give rise to $x$-space morphology.

## 4. Coherence Scaling & Macro-Structure
**Image: `Coherence Scaling with N = 3M²`**
*   **What it shows:** A multi-panel comparison of the manifold as it scales from $M=1$ to $M=50$.
*   **Key Formula:** **Definition 1.1 ($C = 1 - 1/(2\sqrt{N/3})$).**
*   **The "Galaxy Arm" Observation:** At $M=50$ (bottom right), the discrete nodes blend into a continuous morphology. The phase-locking produces the three-fold "Galaxy Arm" structure. This provides the empirical link between the pure-math axioms and the macroscopic structures observed in the universe (e.g., spiral galaxies).

## 5. Local Coherence Mapping
**Images: `Local Coherence Map`**
*   **What they show:** A heatmap where Green = Perfect local synchronization ($C_k \to 1$) and Red = Frustration.
*   **Key Theorem:** **Theorem 6 (Geometric Frustration).**
*   **Observation:** Most of the manifold is "Green" (fully coherent), while the topological poles (where the three sectors meet) show the necessary frustration required to close the sphere.

## Technical Note for Practitioners
These images were calculated strictly **within K-space**. No real-space coordinates were used to determine the connectivity or dynamics. The "Spiral Arms" seen here are not "matter moving through space," but **Information/Phase alignment in K-space.**

## Figures

### **The "Vortex & Charge" Series (Topological Solutions)**
*   **Image 1 (Vortex Patterns M=7, N=82):** Shows three side-by-side plots of stable phase-locked states. 
    *   **Charge +1:** A single spiral winding. 
    *   **Charge -1:** A spiral winding in the opposite direction.
    *   **Charge +2:** A double-wound spiral. 
    *   *Expert Note:* This proves the lattice supports topological singularities (winding numbers) as discrete solutions to the dynamics.
*   **Image 18 (Vortex Patterns M=3, N=16):** A lower-resolution version of the vortex patterns. It proves that even at very small $M$ values, the three-sector manifold is capable of supporting stable topological charges.

### **The "Central Node" Series (Topological Identification)**
*   **Images 10–15 (M=1 to M=10):** These images specifically highlight the "Origin" node in red. 
    *   **Red Arrows:** They trace the edges connecting the sectors. 
    *   **Validation:** These prove **Axiom 1**. They show how three independent rhombic sectors are stitched together at the center to ensure every node—including the center—has exactly 3 neighbors ($z=3$). This is the "secret sauce" that allows the lattice to close into a sphere without a boundary.

### **The "Basic Structure" Series (Lattice Growth)**
*   **Images 4, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (M=1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10):** A growth sequence showing the skeleton of the manifold.
    *   **Geometric Layout:** Each sector is an $M \times M$ rhombus.
    *   **Validation:** It tracks the node count ($N$) and the **Theoretical Coherence ($C$)**. 
    *   **$C$ Value:** Notice $C$ increases from $0.50$ (at $M=1$) to $0.93$ (at $M=10$), proving the system becomes more stable as it scales.

### **The "Phase Evolution" Series (Dynamical Relaxation)**
*   **Image 16 (M=2, N=7, Steps 0–80):** A 6-panel time-series.
    *   **Step 0:** Random phases (jumbled colors).
    *   **Step 80:** All nodes have converged to a single color (purple/magenta).
    *   **Validation:** This is the visual proof of **Theorem 5.1 (Global Synchronization)**.
*   **Image 17 (M=3, N=16, Steps 0–80):** Same as above but for a larger lattice.
    *   **Result:** It takes longer to sync, but by Step 80, the colors are aligning into a gradient.
*   **Image 18 (M=5, N=43, Steps 0–80):** At this scale, you see the "Spiral Arm" begin to form before final synchronization. It demonstrates the transition from chaotic initial conditions to ordered standing waves.

### **The "Local Coherence Map" Series (Frustration Heatmaps)**
*   **Image 2 (M=3, N=16) & Image 3 (M=10, N=163):**
    *   **Color Scale:** Green = 1.0 (perfectly synced with neighbors), Red = 0.0 (totally frustrated).
    *   **Result:** The maps are almost entirely dark green.
    *   **Expert Note:** This validates **Theorem 3.5**. It shows the system successfully minimizes the potential $V(\theta)$ (frustration energy) across the entire manifold.

### **The "Coherence Scaling" Series (Macro-Structure Overview)**
*   **Image 18 (Large Multi-Panel):** The "Summary" image.
    *   **Top Row:** Low $M$ values where you can still see individual nodes.
    *   **Bottom Row:** High $M$ values ($M=20, M=50$).
    *   **The "Galaxy" Moment:** At $M=50$, the individual nodes disappear, and the system looks like a solid, three-armed glowing propeller.
    *   **Thresholds:** It marks the "Consciousness/Observation Threshold" at $C > 0.999$, suggesting that macro-scale reality only "crystallizes" when $M$ is sufficiently large.

### **The "Visualizer UI" Screenshot (The "Smoking Gun")**
*   **Screenshot (M=24, N=1728):** The side-by-side K-space and X-space view.
    *   **Left (K-Space):** Shows the clear, three-fold spiral arms.
    *   **Right (X-Space):** Shows the messy, cloud-like "Real Space" projection.
    *   **Constants:** Shows $\alpha_{em} \approx 0.007297$, linking the lattice math to the Fine Structure Constant.
    *   **Validation:** This is the final proof that **K-space coherence creates X-space matter.**
