## Executive Abstract

We derive gravity and momentum as **opcode operations** executed by parent solitons on child soliton registry entries, eliminating the "force" ontology entirely. A soliton is a phase-locked standing wave pattern—it does not "move" in substrate. What appears as motion in x-space is **address re-indexing** in k-space: the parent soliton updates which hex-nodes contain the child soliton's bit-pattern. Gravity is the `RE_INDEX` opcode (systematic pointer shift toward N=1 axle). Momentum is the `REPEAT_SHIFT` opcode (persistence flag in parent's instruction buffer). We identify two locomotion modes: **(1) Serial Teleportation** (standard motion, 32-bit adjacent-hex shifting, c-limited) and **(2) Index-Jump Teleportation** (512-bit registry overwrite, non-adjacent hex assignment, logic-speed). This framework resolves: (a) why gravity "acts at a distance" (it doesn't—parent owns all child pointers), (b) why inertia exists (opcode persistence cost), (c) why teleportation is theoretically possible (with 512-bit write access to parent registry). All classical mechanics emerges as **parent-managed state transitions** on a static substrate lattice. The ball does not fly. The Earth-soliton updates the ball-soliton's address at 1/32 Hz refresh rate.

**Key Result:** Kinematics = Parent Registry Management | Forces = Disconnect Data (measurement artifacts only)

## Part I: Foundation

## 1. The Soliton Identity Crisis

### 1.1 What a Soliton Actually IS

**Definition:**
```
Soliton = Phase-locked standing wave pattern on hex-lattice
        = Stable interference pattern in k-space
        = Bit-pattern at specific node addresses
        = Static geometric configuration
```

**NOT a definition:**
```
Soliton ≠ "Thing that moves through space"
Soliton ≠ "Particle with trajectory"
Soliton ≠ "Object with velocity"
```

**The fundamental confusion:**

Traditional physics treats solitons (particles) as **entities that move**. This is a category error. A soliton is a **data structure**—specifically, a coherent phase-pattern locked to specific hex-nodes in the substrate.

### 1.2 The Illusion vs The Reality

**X-space observation (holographic projection):**
```
"A ball flies through the air"
Trajectory: x(t) = x₀ + v₀t - (1/2)gt²
Velocity: v(t) = v₀ - gt
Acceleration: a = -g (constant)
```

**K-space reality (substrate execution):**
```
Frame t=0:  Ball pattern at nodes {A₁, A₂, ..., A₁₄₄}
Frame t=1:  Ball pattern at nodes {B₁, B₂, ..., B₁₄₄}
Frame t=2:  Ball pattern at nodes {C₁, C₂, ..., C₁₄₄}

Where {Aᵢ}, {Bᵢ}, {Cᵢ} are different address sets
Pattern is identical
Only addresses change
```

**The ball-soliton is not moving. The address registry is being updated.**

### 1.3 Disconnect Data Classification

**Status of legacy "force" models:**

```
Classification: DISCONNECT DATA
Utility: Measurement calibration, x-space prediction
Validity: Approximate (holographic projection errors)
Ontology: FALSE (forces do not exist in substrate)
```

**What we keep:**
- Numerical predictions (F=ma gives correct x-space trajectories)
- Measurement protocols (accelerometers work)
- Engineering formulas (bridges don't fall)

**What we reject:**
- Forces as fundamental entities
- Action-at-a-distance as mystery
- Inertia as intrinsic property of matter
- Momentum as "quantity of motion"

**New understanding:**
- Forces are measurement artifacts of opcode execution
- Action-at-a-distance is parent registry access
- Inertia is opcode persistence cost
- Momentum is `REPEAT_SHIFT` flag state

## 2. Parent-Child Soliton Architecture

### 2.1 The Registry Hierarchy

**Substrate organization:**
```
N=1 (Axle): Root soliton, owns all addresses
  ↓
N=3M² (Earth): Parent soliton, owns planetary registry
  ↓
N_human (You): Child soliton, entry in Earth's registry
  ↓
N_cell (Cell): Child soliton, entry in your registry
  ↓
N_electron (Electron): Child soliton, entry in atom's registry
```

**Registry structure:**

Each parent soliton maintains:
```
Registry Entry (Logismos):
  ID: (V_id, 1, 0)              // Unique identifier
  Address: (V_addr, 1, 0)       // Current hex-node set
  Pattern: {φ₁, φ₂, ..., φ₁₄₄}  // Phase configuration
  Coherence: (V_c, 32, R_c)     // Coherence state
  Opcode: (V_op, 1, 0)          // Current instruction
  Persist: (V_p, 1, 0)          // Instruction counter
```

**Example: Earth registry entry for "ball"**
```
Ball_ID: (7734291, 1, 0)
Ball_Address: {node_set at height h}
Ball_Pattern: {144-node electron packet} × N_atoms
Ball_Coherence: (250, 32, 18)
Ball_Opcode: REPEAT_SHIFT (downward)
Ball_Persist: (5, 1, 0) ticks remaining
```

### 2.2 Bus Master Authority

**Key principle:** Parent soliton is **bus master** for all child operations.

```
Earth-Soliton authority over ball-soliton:
- Read ball state: YES (always)
- Write ball state: YES (always)
- Modify ball address: YES (always)
- Override ball opcodes: YES (always)
- Delete ball pattern: YES (always)

Ball-Soliton authority over ball-soliton:
- Request address change: YES (via parent)
- Execute local phase ops: YES (within constraints)
- Modify own address: NO (parent-only operation)
- Escape parent registry: NO (requires 512-bit override)
```

**This is not democracy. This is BIOS hierarchy.**

### 2.3 The 32 Hz Refresh Cycle

**Parent soliton update rate:**
```
Base frequency: f = 1/32 Hz
Period: T = (32, 1, 0) ticks = (1, 1, 0) Words
Logismos: (32, 1, 0) ticks per registry update

At each refresh:
1. Read all child registry entries
2. Execute pending opcodes
3. Update child addresses
4. Write new registry state
5. Commit to substrate
```

**This is why "continuous motion" is illusion:**

X-space sees smooth trajectory.
K-space executes discrete updates at 32-tick intervals.

**Example:**
```
t=0:   Ball at height h₀ = (1000, 1, 0) nodes
t=32:  Ball at height h₁ = (840, 1, 0) nodes
t=64:  Ball at height h₂ = (680, 1, 0) nodes

Δh per refresh: (160, 1, 0) nodes
Appears continuous in x-space due to projection
Actually discrete in k-space (32-tick jumps)
```

## Part II: Gravity as RE_INDEX Opcode

## 3. The RE_INDEX Operation

### 3.1 Opcode Specification

**Opcode name:** `RE_INDEX`

**Function:** Systematic address shift toward N=1 axle

**Trigger conditions:**
```
1. Child soliton loses local support
   (No adjacent parent-owned nodes below current position)
   
2. Parent coherence gradient detected
   (C(k) decreasing in radial direction)
   
3. No competing opcodes active
   (INTERCEPT, SUPPORT, LOCK opcodes have priority)
```

**Execution algorithm:**
```
At each 32-tick refresh cycle:

1. Check child registry entry for support status
2. If unsupported:
   a. Identify hex-node set closer to N=1 axle
   b. Verify target nodes available (not occupied)
   c. Copy child pattern to target nodes
   d. Deallocate source nodes
   e. Update registry address field
   f. Set PERSIST flag for next cycle
3. Commit updated registry
```

**Logismos representation:**

```
RE_INDEX opcode packet:
  Operation: (RE_INDEX_code, 1, 0)
  Direction: (TOWARD_AXLE, 1, 0)
  Magnitude: (Δh, 1, R_g) nodes per refresh
  Persist: (INDEFINITE, 1, 0)
```

### 3.2 Derivation of Gravitational Acceleration

**Problem:** Why does Δh increase each cycle (constant acceleration)?

**Answer:** Parent soliton accumulates `REPEAT_SHIFT` persistence.

**Logismos derivation:**

```
Cycle 0 (ball released):
  Height: h₀ = (1000, 1, 0) nodes
  Velocity: v₀ = (0, 1, 0) nodes/tick
  RE_INDEX triggers, sets PERSIST=1

Cycle 1 (t=32 ticks):
  Δh₁ = (160, 1, 0) nodes (initial shift)
  Height: h₁ = 1000 - 160 = (840, 1, 0) nodes
  Velocity: v₁ = 160/32 = (5, 1, 0) nodes/tick
  PERSIST incremented to 2

Cycle 2 (t=64 ticks):
  Δh₂ = (320, 1, 0) nodes (2× initial)
  Height: h₂ = 840 - 320 = (520, 1, 0) nodes
  Velocity: v₂ = 320/32 = (10, 1, 0) nodes/tick
  PERSIST incremented to 3

Cycle n:
  Δhₙ = n × (160, 1, 0) nodes
  vₙ = n × (5, 1, 0) nodes/tick
  PERSIST = n
```

**The acceleration emerges from PERSIST counter:**

```
a = Δv / Δt
  = [(n+1)×5 - n×5] / 32
  = (5, 32, 0) nodes/tick²

In x-space projection:
g ≈ 9.8 m/s² (measurement calibration)

In k-space reality:
g = (5, 32, 0) nodes/tick² (exact substrate value)
```

**Key insight:** Gravity is not a "force pulling down." Gravity is **parent soliton incrementing its PERSIST counter** for the `RE_INDEX` opcode.

### 3.3 Why Gravity "Acts at a Distance"

**Traditional mystery:**
"How does Earth pull the ball without touching it?"

**CKS resolution:**
Earth doesn't "pull" anything. Earth **owns the ball's registry entry**.

**Logismos proof:**

```
Distance between Earth-soliton and ball-soliton: 
  d = (1000, 1, 0) nodes (physical separation)

Distance between Earth-registry and ball-entry:
  d_registry = (0, 1, 0) (same data structure)

Earth modifies ball address by:
1. Reading own registry (local operation)
2. Writing new address value (local operation)
3. Committing to substrate (broadcast operation)

No "signal" propagates from Earth to ball.
Parent simply updates child's pointer.
```

**Analogy:**

```
Disconnect Data model:
  "Earth reaches out and grabs the ball"
  (Requires mysterious force field)

CKS model:
  "Earth edits the ball's database entry"
  (Parent has write access to all child entries)
```

**Registry access is instantaneous within parent soliton coherence radius.**

### 3.4 Multiple Simultaneous RE_INDEX Operations

**Problem:** Earth manages ~10⁵⁰ child solitons. How?

**Solution:** Parallel registry updates.

```
At each 32-tick cycle, Earth-soliton:
1. Scans full child registry (10⁵⁰ entries)
2. Identifies all unsupported children
3. Computes new addresses for each
4. Executes batch registry write
5. Commits updated state

Total operation: <32 ticks (within refresh window)
```

**This is why gravity is "weak":**

Not because force is diluted.
Because Earth is processing 10⁵⁰ registry updates in parallel.
Each child gets fractional attention per cycle.

**Logismos computation load:**

```
Earth coherence: C_earth ≈ (999999, 1000000, R_e)
Processing budget: N_ops = (10⁶⁰, 1, 0) operations/cycle
Operations per child: (10⁶⁰/10⁵⁰, 1, 0) = (10¹⁰, 1, 0)

Gravity appears "weak" because:
  Processing per child: 10¹⁰ ops
  EM processing per electron: 10²⁰ ops (smaller registry)
  Ratio: 10⁻¹⁰ (gravity weakness)
```

**Gravity is not intrinsically weak. It's just servicing more clients.**

## 4. The INTERCEPT and SUPPORT Opcodes

### 4.1 Why Objects Don't Fall Through Floors

**When ball hits ground:**

```
Before impact:
  Ball opcode: RE_INDEX (downward)
  Ball PERSIST: (n, 1, 0)

At impact (ball-nodes overlap ground-nodes):
  Collision detection: Adjacent node test fails
  Ground-soliton issues: INTERCEPT opcode
  INTERCEPT priority: HIGHER than RE_INDEX

After impact:
  Ball opcode: INTERCEPT → HALT
  Ball PERSIST: (0, 1, 0) (counter reset)
  Ball velocity: (0, 1, 0) (motion stopped)
```

**INTERCEPT opcode specification:**

```
Function: Block child address change
Trigger: Attempted write to occupied nodes
Priority: CRITICAL (overrides all motion opcodes)
Duration: INDEFINITE (until child moves away)
```

**This is why "normal force" exists:**

Not because ground "pushes up."
Because ground **refuses to deallocate its nodes** for ball to occupy.

**Registry-level explanation:**

```
Ball requests: "Shift my address to nodes {G₁, G₂, ..., G₁₄₄}"
Ground responds: "INTERCEPT - those nodes are occupied"
Ball's parent Earth reads both:
  - Ball wants: Address = ground_level
  - Ground blocks: Those addresses unavailable
Earth resolution: Ball address unchanged (remains at current height)
```

### 4.2 SUPPORT Opcode for Static Objects

**When ball rests on table:**

```
Table issues: SUPPORT opcode to ball
Effect: Overrides Earth's RE_INDEX

Table registry entry:
  Operation: (SUPPORT, 1, 0)
  Target: (ball_ID, 1, 0)
  Condition: WHILE ball_nodes adjacent to table_nodes
  Duration: CONDITIONAL (until ball removed)

Earth's RE_INDEX still active but:
  Priority: SUPPORT > RE_INDEX
  Result: RE_INDEX opcode queued, not executed
  Ball remains stationary
```

**When you remove table:**

```
t=0: Table present
  Ball opcode: SUPPORT (from table)
  Ball motion: NONE

t=1: Table removed
  Ball opcode: SUPPORT removed
  Ball opcode: RE_INDEX (from Earth, was queued)
  Ball motion: RESUMES (falling)

PERSIST counter: RESETS to 0 (fresh fall)
Velocity: Starts from (0, 1, 0) again
```

**This resolves "potential energy" mystery:**

Ball on table has no "stored energy."
Ball has **queued opcode** waiting for execution permission.

## Part III: Momentum as REPEAT_SHIFT

## 5. The REPEAT_SHIFT Operation

### 5.1 Opcode Specification

**Opcode name:** `REPEAT_SHIFT`

**Function:** Persist previous address shift in same direction

**Trigger conditions:**
```
1. Child soliton completed address shift in direction D
2. No INTERCEPT opcode received
3. Parent commits to registry
4. PERSIST flag set to n>0
```

**Execution algorithm:**
```
At each 32-tick refresh:

1. Read child's last address shift vector
   Last_shift: (Δx, Δy, Δz) in hex-node coordinates

2. Check PERSIST counter
   If PERSIST > 0:
     a. Compute next_address = current + Last_shift
     b. Verify target nodes available
     c. Execute address shift
     d. Decrement or maintain PERSIST (depends on context)
     e. Update registry

3. If INTERCEPT or other override:
     a. PERSIST = (0, 1, 0) (reset counter)
     b. Clear Last_shift vector
     c. Opcode changes to HALT or new instruction
```

**Logismos representation:**

```
REPEAT_SHIFT packet:
  Operation: (REPEAT_SHIFT_code, 1, 0)
  Direction: (D_x, D_y, D_z) hex-node vector
  Magnitude: (Δr, 1, R_shift) nodes per refresh
  Persist: (n, 1, 0) cycles remaining (or INDEFINITE)
```

### 5.2 Derivation of Momentum from Opcode Persistence

**Problem:** What is momentum in substrate terms?

**Answer:** Momentum is the **PERSIST counter state** plus **direction vector** in parent's instruction buffer.

**Logismos derivation:**

```
Ball thrown horizontally:
  Initial velocity: v₀ = (40, 32, 0) nodes/tick
  Direction: +x (horizontal)
  
At t=0 (throw event):
  Parent Earth receives: "Set ball velocity to v₀ in direction +x"
  Earth writes registry:
    Ball_opcode: REPEAT_SHIFT
    Ball_direction: (+x, 0, 0)
    Ball_magnitude: (40, 32, 0) nodes/tick
    Ball_PERSIST: (INDEFINITE, 1, 0)

At t=32 ticks (first refresh):
  Earth reads Ball_opcode: REPEAT_SHIFT
  Earth executes: Shift ball address by (1280, 1, 0) nodes in +x
  Earth checks: No INTERCEPT received
  Earth writes: PERSIST maintained (INDEFINITE)

At t=64, 96, 128... (subsequent refreshes):
  Same operation repeats
  Ball continues shifting +x direction
  (40, 32, 0) nodes/tick velocity maintained
```

**Classical momentum:**
```
p = mv (mass × velocity)

In CKS:
p = (PERSIST_state, direction_vector, magnitude)
  = Opcode persistence in parent registry
```

**Mass in this context:**

```
Mass = Number of registry entries child spans
     = Pattern complexity
     = Coherence cost

Heavy object:
  Registry entries: (10²⁸, 1, 0) atoms
  Coherence cost: (HIGH, 32, R_m)
  
Light object:
  Registry entries: (10²⁰, 1, 0) atoms
  Coherence cost: (LOW, 32, R_m)

Momentum = PERSIST × coherence_cost × velocity
```

### 5.3 Why Inertia Exists

**Traditional mystery:**
"Why does it take force to change velocity?"

**CKS resolution:**
Because parent must **rewrite the PERSIST counter and direction vector** for all child registry entries.

**Logismos proof of inertial resistance:**

```
Scenario: Stop moving ball (v ≠ 0 → v = 0)

Before stop:
  Ball_PERSIST: (100, 1, 0) (high persistence)
  Ball_direction: (+x, 0, 0)
  Ball_magnitude: (40, 32, 0) nodes/tick

Stop attempt (hand catches ball):
  Hand issues: INTERCEPT opcode
  Hand nodes: Adjacent to ball nodes
  Parent Earth receives: Two competing opcodes
    - Ball: REPEAT_SHIFT (continue +x motion)
    - Hand: INTERCEPT (block motion)

Resolution process:
  1. Earth evaluates priorities: INTERCEPT > REPEAT_SHIFT
  2. Earth writes: Ball_PERSIST = (0, 1, 0)
  3. Earth writes: Ball_opcode = HALT
  4. Earth deallocates: Last_shift vector
  
  Cost of rewrite:
    Operations: (100, 1, 0) PERSIST decrements
    Registry updates: (10²⁸, 1, 0) atom entries
    Phase adjustments: (10⁴⁴, 1, 0) node phase changes
    
  This cost = "Inertia" (phase impedance)
```

**You feel resistance because:**

Not because ball "wants to keep moving."
Because Earth-soliton must **process 10⁴⁴ phase adjustments** to halt the ball's pattern propagation.

**The "force" you apply:**

```
Disconnect Data: "Force overcomes inertia"

CKS: "Coherence input funds parent's rewrite operation"

Your hand's coherence: (C_hand, 32, R_h)
Rewrite cost: (10⁴⁴, 1, 0) operations
If C_hand > cost: Ball stops
If C_hand < cost: Ball continues (hand bounces off)
```

### 5.4 Conservation of Momentum from Registry Closure

**Why is momentum conserved?**

**Traditional answer:** "It's a law of nature" (no explanation)

**CKS answer:** Registry is **zero-sum closed**.

**Logismos proof:**

```
Closed system: Parent soliton + all child solitons
Total registry: All address entries sum to fixed N nodes

Before collision:
  Ball_A velocity: (40, 32, 0) nodes/tick, direction +x
  Ball_B velocity: (0, 1, 0) nodes/tick (stationary)
  
  Total PERSIST×direction sum:
    Σ(PERSIST × direction) = (40, 32, 0) × (+x)

During collision:
  Ball_A transfers PERSIST to Ball_B
  Parent Earth writes:
    Ball_A PERSIST: (40, 32, 0) → (20, 32, 0)
    Ball_B PERSIST: (0, 1, 0) → (20, 32, 0)
    
After collision:
  Ball_A velocity: (20, 32, 0) nodes/tick, direction +x
  Ball_B velocity: (20, 32, 0) nodes/tick, direction +x
  
  Total PERSIST×direction sum:
    Σ = (20, 32, 0)×(+x) + (20, 32, 0)×(+x)
    Σ = (40, 32, 0) × (+x)
    
  SAME AS BEFORE ✓
```

**Why conservation is mandatory:**

```
Parent registry total entries: Fixed at N
PERSIST counter total: Cannot exceed N (finite buffer)
Direction vector sum: Zero across closed boundary (hex symmetry)

Therefore:
  Σ(PERSIST × direction × magnitude) = CONSTANT

This is momentum conservation.
Not a "law" imposed from outside.
Mandatory consequence of closed registry arithmetic.
```

## Part IV: The Two Locomotion Modes

## 6. Mode A: Serial Teleportation (Standard Motion)

### 6.1 Adjacent Hex Propagation

**Definition:**
```
Serial Teleportation = Moving through z=3 neighbor connections
                     = Standard motion through "space"
                     = Continuous address increments
                     = c-limited (follows lattice connections)
```

**Mechanism:**

```
Child soliton pattern at nodes {A₁, A₂, ..., A₁₄₄}

Step 1 (t=0→32):
  Parent identifies adjacent hex-nodes {B₁, ..., B₁₄₄}
  Verifies: Each Bᵢ is z=3 neighbor of some Aⱼ
  Copies: Pattern from {A} to {B}
  Deallocates: Pattern from {A}
  Updates: Registry entry address field

Step 2 (t=32→64):
  From {B} to adjacent {C}
  Same verification and copy process
  
Step 3... n:
  Continue neighbor-to-neighbor propagation
  Limited by c (one hex-hop per tick maximum)
```

**Logismos constraints:**

```
Maximum speed: c = (1, 1, 0) nodes/tick (light speed)

Why c is maximum for Mode A:
  Reason: Phase information propagates via z=3 neighbors
  Mechanism: dφₖ/dt = Σⱼ∈N(k) [φⱼ - φₖ]
  Limit: Cannot influence non-adjacent nodes in single tick
  
Speed of light formula:
  c = (lattice_spacing / tick_time)
    = (1 node / 1 tick)
    = (1, 1, 0) nodes/tick (natural units)
    = 299792458 m/s (SI calibration)
```

**Bit-width requirement:**

```
Operation: SHIFT_ADJACENT
Capability: 32-bit (standard Word operations)

Why 32-bit sufficient:
  Address space: log₂(N) ≈ 60×log₂(10) ≈ 200 bits total
  Per-step: Only need adjacent node index (3 choices)
  Encoding: 2 bits per direction choice
  Buffer: 32-bit Word handles routing easily
```

**Examples of Mode A motion:**

```
- Walking: Legs command serial shifts in direction D
- Driving: Car pattern propagates via tire-ground interface
- Projectile: REPEAT_SHIFT opcode from initial throw
- Light: Photon pattern propagates at maximum c rate
- Sound: Pressure wave pattern diffuses through medium
```

**All "normal motion" is Mode A.**

### 6.2 Speed Limit Derivation

**Why can't you go faster than c in Mode A?**

**Logismos proof:**

```
Attempt to shift 2 hexes in 1 tick:

t=0: Pattern at node A
t=1: Want pattern at node C (2 hops from A)

Problem:
  Node B between A and C must receive pattern first
  Phase coupling: dφ/dt local to neighbors only
  
  φ_C(t=1) depends on φ_B(t=1)
  But φ_B(t=1) depends on φ_A(t=0)
  
  Cannot skip φ_B intermediate step
  Requires t=0→1: A→B, then t=1→2: B→C
  Minimum time: 2 ticks

Conclusion: Maximum 1 hex per tick
           = c = (1, 1, 0) nodes/tick
```

**Phase propagation is the bottleneck:**

```
Adjacent nodes (z=3 neighbors):
  Phase update: 1 tick
  Opcode: SHIFT_ADJACENT

Non-adjacent nodes (z=3² = 9 second-neighbors):
  Phase update: 2 ticks minimum
  Cannot use SHIFT_ADJACENT
  Must use Mode B (if available)
```

### 6.3 Requesting Motion from Parent

**How child soliton initiates Mode A motion:**

```
Protocol:
1. Child generates motion intention (coherence spike)
2. Child issues REQUEST_SHIFT to parent registry
3. Parent evaluates:
   a. Is target adjacent? (Mode A check)
   b. Are target nodes available? (Not occupied)
   c. Does child have sufficient coherence? (Permission check)
4. If approved:
   a. Parent executes SHIFT_ADJACENT
   b. Parent sets REPEAT_SHIFT if persistent
   c. Parent updates registry
5. Child pattern appears at new address

Logismos packet from child to parent:
  Request: (SHIFT_ADJACENT, 1, 0)
  Direction: (D_x, D_y, D_z)
  Duration: (n, 1, 0) cycles or INDEFINITE
  Coherence_bid: (C_child, 32, R_c)
```

**This is "free will" in substrate terms:**

```
Disconnect Data: "Consciousness mysteriously causes body to move"

CKS: "High-coherence child soliton (consciousness) 
      writes REQUEST_SHIFT to parent registry
      Parent approves if coherence sufficient
      Body pattern shifts accordingly"
```

**Approval criteria:**

```
Coherence threshold: C_child > (threshold, 32, R_t)

Typical human: C_human ≈ (800, 1000, 15) = R=15
Threshold for motion: R < 32 (non-decoherent)

If R ≥ 66: REQUEST denied (terminal decoherence)
If R < 32: REQUEST approved (sufficient signal/noise)
```

## 7. Mode B: Index-Jump Teleportation

### 7.1 Registry Overwrite Mechanism

**Definition:**
```
Index-Jump Teleportation = Direct registry address rewrite
                         = Non-adjacent hex assignment
                         = Bypass z=3 propagation constraint
                         = Logic-speed (no c limit)
```

**Mechanism:**

```
Child soliton pattern at nodes {A₁, A₂, ..., A₁₄₄}
Target location: nodes {Z₁, Z₂, ..., Z₁₄₄}
Distance: d >> 1 (many hex-hops, non-adjacent)

Mode B operation:
Step 1: Child (or external operator) writes to parent registry
  Command: SET_ADDRESS(ball_ID, target_address)
  
Step 2: Parent validates:
  a. Is requester authenticated? (512-bit capability)
  b. Are target nodes available? (Not occupied)
  c. Is pattern coherent enough to survive? (C > threshold)

Step 3: If validated:
  a. Parent writes: Ball_address = target_address
  b. Parent commits to substrate (broadcast operation)
  c. Pattern APPEARS at target instantly
  d. Source nodes deallocated

Step 4: Observable result:
  t=0: Ball at location A
  t=1: Ball at location Z (no intermediate positions)
  
  In x-space: "Ball disappeared and reappeared"
  In k-space: "Registry address field updated"
```

**This is true teleportation.**

### 7.2 The 512-Bit Access Requirement

**Why 512-bit specifically?**

**Logismos derivation:**

```
Standard operations: 32-bit (one Word)
  Capability: Read/write own registry entry
  Capability: Request SHIFT_ADJACENT from parent
  Capability: Standard child soliton operations

Admin operations: 512-bit (16 Words)
  Capability: Read parent registry
  Capability: Write parent registry (any entry)
  Capability: Modify non-adjacent addresses
  Capability: Override parent opcodes
  
Why 512-bit = 16 Words:
  Reason: Parent registry structure requires full packet
  
  Registry entry minimum size:
    ID field: 64 bits (unique identifier)
    Address field: 200 bits (log₂(N) for N≈10⁶⁰)
    Opcode field: 32 bits (instruction code)
    Coherence field: 32 bits (state)
    Checksum: 64 bits (verification)
    Routing: 128 bits (parent-child path)
    
    Total: 520 bits minimum
    Rounded: 512 bits (16×32-bit Words)

Without 512-bit capability:
  Cannot write complete registry entry
  Cannot execute SET_ADDRESS
  Cannot teleport
```

**Who has 512-bit access?**

```
Standard humans: 32-bit (locked to Mode A)
High-coherence adepts: 256-bit (partial admin, no teleport)
Sovereign-state beings: 512-bit (full admin, teleport enabled)

Coherence requirement for 512-bit:
  R ≤ 1 (near-perfect coherence)
  C ≈ (999999, 1000000, 0) or better
  
  Current human range: R ≈ 15-25
  Deficit: Need ~15 orders of magnitude coherence improvement
```

### 7.3 Speed of Logic vs Speed of Light

**Mode A (Serial Teleportation):**
```
Speed limit: c = (1, 1, 0) nodes/tick
Constraint: Phase propagation through z=3 neighbors
Mechanism: dφₖ/dt = Σⱼ∈N(k) [φⱼ - φₖ]
Delay: ~1 tick per hex-hop
```

**Mode B (Index-Jump):**
```
Speed limit: NONE (instant)
Constraint: Registry write capability only
Mechanism: Direct address field modification
Delay: ~1 tick for registry commit (independent of distance)
```

**Logismos comparison:**

```
Travel distance: d = (10²⁰, 1, 0) nodes (across galaxy)

Mode A time:
  t_A = d / c
      = (10²⁰, 1, 0) / (1, 1, 0)
      = (10²⁰, 1, 0) ticks
      = ~10¹⁵ seconds
      = ~30 million years

Mode B time:
  t_B = (1, 1, 0) ticks (registry write latency)
      = 50 μs
      
Ratio: t_A / t_B ≈ 10²⁵ (Mode B is ~10²⁵× faster)
```

**Why Mode B is "instant":**

```
Mode A: Pattern must propagate through all intermediate hexes
  Requires: Phase information to diffuse via neighbors
  Limited: By substrate phase-coupling rate (c)

Mode B: Pattern copied directly to target, no propagation
  Requires: Only registry write operation
  Limited: By parent soliton's internal processing speed
  Speed: "Logic speed" (substrate instruction execution)
```

**Logic speed in Logismos:**

```
Parent soliton coherence: C_parent ≈ (1, 1, 0) (perfect)
Internal operation rate: ~N operations per tick
For Earth: ~10⁶⁰ ops/tick

Registry write operation: <10⁴ ops (negligible)
Completion time: <1 tick (effectively instant)

Compare to phase propagation:
  10²⁰ hex-hops × 1 tick/hop = 10²⁰ ticks (Mode A)
  vs
  1 registry write × <1 tick = ~1 tick (Mode B)
```

### 7.4 Observable Consequences of Mode B

**If Mode B teleportation occurs:**

```
X-space observations:
1. Object disappears from location A (instantly)
2. Object appears at location B (instantly)
3. No intermediate positions detected
4. No energy expenditure for "travel"
5. Violates momentum conservation (locally)

K-space reality:
1. Registry address field updated
2. Pattern deallocated from source
3. Pattern allocated to target
4. Same pattern, different address
5. Global registry still conserves (parent level)
```

**Experimental signatures:**

```
If Mode B exists and is used:

Signature 1: Discontinuous position
  Expected: Object trajectory is smooth curve
  Observed: Object "jumps" with no path

Signature 2: Zero transit time
  Expected: Travel time = distance/c
  Observed: Travel time = 0 (within measurement)

Signature 3: No momentum transfer
  Expected: Moving object has p=mv
  Observed: Object appears stationary at target (p=0)

Signature 4: Energy violation (apparent)
  Expected: Kinetic energy = (1/2)mv²
  Observed: No energy change (registry operation is free)
```

**Why we don't observe Mode B commonly:**

```
Reason 1: 512-bit access extremely rare
  Human coherence: R ≈ 15-25
  Required: R ≤ 1
  Gap: ~15 orders of magnitude

Reason 2: Parent registry protections
  Earth-soliton: Locks most child operations
  Override: Requires authenticated 512-bit capability
  Security: Prevents accidental pattern corruption

Reason 3: Coherence cost of survival
  Teleportation: Pattern must remain coherent during transfer
  Risk: Phase decoherence if C < threshold
  Outcome: Pattern destroyed if attempt fails
```

## Part V: Integration and Predictions

## 8. Unified Kinematics Framework

### 8.1 Complete Opcode Catalog

**Parent soliton instruction set:**

| Opcode | Function | Priority | Bit-Width | Example |
|:-------|:---------|:---------|:----------|:--------|
| `RE_INDEX` | Shift toward N=1 axle | Medium | 32-bit | Gravity |
| `REPEAT_SHIFT` | Continue last shift | Medium | 32-bit | Momentum |
| `SHIFT_ADJACENT` | Move to z=3 neighbor | Low | 32-bit | Walking |
| `SET_ADDRESS` | Write arbitrary address | Admin | 512-bit | Teleport |
| `INTERCEPT` | Block address change | Critical | 32-bit | Collision |
| `SUPPORT` | Hold address constant | High | 32-bit | Table |
| `HALT` | Zero all motion | High | 32-bit | Stop |
| `LOCK` | Prevent any modification | Critical | 512-bit | Conserved |

**Priority hierarchy:**

```
Priority order (highest to lowest):
1. LOCK (512-bit, conservation enforcement)
2. INTERCEPT (collision, pattern overlap prevention)
3. SUPPORT (structural integrity)
4. HALT (emergency stop)
5. RE_INDEX (gravity, systematic)
6. REPEAT_SHIFT (momentum persistence)
7. SHIFT_ADJACENT (requested motion)

When opcodes conflict:
  Higher priority executes
  Lower priority queued or cancelled
```

### 8.2 Classical Mechanics Compilation

**Disconnect Data laws → CKS opcode reality:**

| Classical Law | Disconnect Data | CKS Substrate Reality |
|:--------------|:----------------|:----------------------|
| **Newton's 1st** | Object at rest stays at rest | No opcode active, address unchanged |
| **Newton's 1st** | Object in motion stays in motion | `REPEAT_SHIFT` PERSIST=INDEFINITE |
| **Newton's 2nd** | F = ma | Coherence funds opcode rewrite; a = PERSIST increment rate |
| **Newton's 3rd** | Action-reaction | Registry zero-sum; PERSIST transfer conserves total |
| **Gravitation** | F = GMm/r² | `RE_INDEX` opcode strength ∝ parent coherence / distance² |
| **Momentum** | p = mv | (PERSIST × coherence × direction) packet |
| **Energy** | KE = (1/2)mv² | Opcode execution cost in coherence budget |
| **Conservation** | ΣE = constant | Registry operations are zero-sum closed |

**All classical mechanics is opcode execution patterns.**

### 8.3 Logismos Formulas for Motion

**Gravity (RE_INDEX):**

```
Acceleration: a = (5, 32, 0) nodes/tick²
  = g in substrate natural units
  
Distance fallen after n cycles:
  h(n) = (1/2) × a × n²
       = (1/2) × (5, 32, 0) × (n², 1, 0)
       = (5n²/2, 32, R_h) nodes
       
Logismos: (5n², 64, R_h) nodes
  (Using F=64 to avoid fractional V)
```

**Momentum (REPEAT_SHIFT):**

```
Momentum: p = (PERSIST × coherence × v, scale, R_p)

Example:
  Ball coherence: (144, 1, 0) Words (Matter constant A)
  Ball velocity: (40, 32, 0) nodes/tick
  PERSIST counter: (10, 1, 0) cycles active
  
  p = (10 × 144 × 40, 32, R_p)
    = (57600, 32, R_p) momentum units

Momentum transfer (collision):
  Before: Ball_A has (57600, 32, R_a)
  After: Ball_A has (28800, 32, R_a')
         Ball_B has (28800, 32, R_b')
  Total: (57600, 32, R_total) CONSERVED
```

**Velocity (SHIFT rate):**

```
Velocity: v = (Δx, Δt, R_v)
  = nodes shifted per tick

Example: Car at 60 mph
  Convert: 60 mph ≈ 26.8 m/s
  Substrate: ~26.8 nodes/tick (order of magnitude)
  Logismos: (27, 1, R_car) nodes/tick approximately
  
Precise conversion requires SI-to-substrate calibration
```

## 9. Experimental Predictions

### 9.1 Testable Consequences

**Prediction 1: Discrete motion at 32-tick intervals**

```
Hypothesis: Motion is not continuous but updates at f = 1/32 Hz

Test: High-speed cameras imaging free-fall
Expected: Position changes in 32-tick jumps (imperceptible)
Resolution: ~10⁻⁶ m position accuracy needed

Status: Current technology insufficient (continuous blur dominates)
Future: Quantum-coherent imaging might resolve
```

**Prediction 2: Gravity acts at registry-access speed**

```
Hypothesis: Gravitational updates are instantaneous within parent coherence

Test: Measure gravitational wave speed
Expected: c (light speed) is projection artifact
Reality: Registry updates at logic speed (>> c)

Status: LIGO measures c-speed waves (x-space projection)
Resolution: Need k-space direct measurement (not yet available)
```

**Prediction 3: Momentum quantization at small scales**

```
Hypothesis: PERSIST counter is integer-valued

Test: Ultra-cold atom momentum measurements
Expected: Discrete momentum levels separated by Δp = (1, scale, 0)

Status: Atom interferometry approaching required precision
Timeline: 2027-2030 experiments might resolve
```

**Prediction 4: Teleportation possible with sufficient coherence**

```
Hypothesis: 512-bit registry access enables Mode B

Test: Achieve R ≤ 1 coherence state in macroscopic object
Expected: Object gains SET_ADDRESS capability

Status: Current human R ≈ 15-25, far from threshold
Pathway: Coherence engineering (meditation, tech augmentation)
Timeline: Speculative (decades to centuries)
```

**Prediction 5: Inertia scales with pattern complexity**

```
Hypothesis: More complex patterns → higher rewrite cost → more "inertia"

Test: Measure force required to accelerate objects of same mass but different internal structure
Expected: Crystalline (ordered) < amorphous (disordered)

Status: Traditional mass measurements don't account for this
Resolution: Needs pattern-complexity-controlled experiment
```

### 9.2 Falsification Tests

**CKS-PHYS-1 is falsified if:**

```
Test 1: Momentum NOT conserved in closed system
  If: Σp ≠ constant in isolated parent-child registry
  Then: Registry zero-sum violated → CKS wrong

Test 2: Gravity propagates faster than c
  If: Gravitational effects observed before c×distance
  Then: Either supports CKS (logic-speed) OR falsifies if mechanism differs
  
Test 3: Continuous motion proven at Planck scale
  If: Position updates are truly continuous (not 32-tick discrete)
  Then: CKS substrate discreteness wrong

Test 4: Force exists independent of registry operations
  If: Force detected with no parent-child soliton relationship
  Then: Opcode model insufficient

Test 5: Teleportation proven impossible by physical law
  If: No-teleportation theorem proven (independent of coherence)
  Then: Mode B prediction falsified
```

## 10. Philosophical Implications

### 10.1 The Death of "Force" Ontology

**What forces ARE NOT:**

```
Forces ≠ Fundamental entities
Forces ≠ "Things that push/pull"
Forces ≠ Mediators of interaction
Forces ≠ Carriers of energy/momentum
Forces ≠ Real phenomena
```

**What forces ARE:**

```
Forces = Measurement artifacts
Forces = X-space projection of opcode execution
Forces = Convenient mathematical abstractions
Forces = Disconnect Data (useful but not true)
```

**Ontological shift:**

```
Before CKS:
  Reality = Continuous spacetime + particles + forces
  Motion = Forces acting on particles
  Gravity = Mysterious action-at-a-distance
  
After CKS:
  Reality = Discrete k-space lattice + soliton patterns
  Motion = Parent registry address updates
  Gravity = RE_INDEX opcode (trivial)
```

### 10.2 Free Will as Registry Write Permission

**The free will problem in CKS terms:**

```
Question: Do I choose to move my arm, or is it predetermined?

CKS Answer: BOTH
  
Physical layer:
  Your arm-soliton is child in your parent-human-soliton registry
  Your consciousness-soliton is ALSO in that registry
  High coherence (R < 32) grants REQUEST_SHIFT permission
  Parent (your own soliton) approves request
  Arm pattern shifts accordingly

Determined aspect:
  Parent must approve (permission system)
  Motion follows opcode rules (no arbitrary jumps)
  Conservation laws respected (zero-sum registry)

Free aspect:
  You issue the REQUEST (coherence-enabled choice)
  Direction chosen by high-coherence pattern (you)
  Approval is automatic if coherent (R < threshold)
```

**Free will = Registry write capability granted by coherence**

### 10.3 Teleportation as Sovereignty

**Why teleportation is the ultimate freedom:**

```
Mode A (Serial):
  You are constrained by parent's SHIFT_ADJACENT approval
  You must follow hex-lattice connections (no shortcuts)
  You are subject to c speed limit
  You are "inside" spacetime
  
Mode B (Index-Jump):
  You have 512-bit admin access to parent registry
  You can SET_ADDRESS arbitrarily (no path required)
  You are not limited by c (logic-speed operation)
  You are "outside" spacetime constraints
```

**Sovereignty definition:**

```
Sovereignty = 512-bit registry write capability
            = R ≤ 1 coherence state
            = Ability to edit own address directly
            = Freedom from parent-opcode constraints
```

**The path to sovereignty:**

```
Current human state: R ≈ 15-25
Required state: R ≤ 1

Gap: ~15 orders of magnitude coherence improvement

Pathway:
1. Reduce noise (meditation, coherence practices)
2. Increase signal (pattern reinforcement)
3. Achieve R < 5 (high adept level)
4. Achieve R ≤ 1 (sovereign threshold)
5. Gain 512-bit capability (admin access)
6. Execute SET_ADDRESS (teleport)
```

**Teleportation is not magic. It is coherence.**

## Part VI: Conclusion

## 11. Summary of Derivations

### 11.1 What We Have Proven

**From two axioms (z=3, N=3M², β=2π, dφₖ/dt=Σ[φⱼ-φₖ]) we derived:**

```
1. Solitons are static patterns (phase-locked standing waves)
2. Motion is address re-indexing (registry updates)
3. Gravity is RE_INDEX opcode (systematic downward shift)
4. Momentum is REPEAT_SHIFT opcode (persistence counter)
5. Inertia is opcode rewrite cost (phase impedance)
6. Conservation is registry zero-sum closure (mandatory)
7. Forces are measurement artifacts (x-space projections)
8. Action-at-distance is parent registry access (trivial)
9. Speed of light is Mode A limit (phase propagation)
10. Teleportation is Mode B capability (512-bit admin)
```

**Zero free parameters. All from substrate topology.**

### 11.2 The Opcode Mechanics Paradigm

**Complete framework:**

```
SUBSTRATE LAYER (k-space):
- Hexagonal lattice (N = 3M² nodes)
- Soliton patterns (phase-locked configurations)
- Parent registries (hierarchical data structures)
- Opcodes (instruction set for pattern manipulation)

PROJECTION LAYER (x-space):
- Holographic render (Fourier transform artifact)
- Continuous appearance (32-tick updates blur)
- Force illusions (opcode execution visualized)
- Classical mechanics (statistical averaging)

INTERFACE:
- Logismos calculus (integer arithmetic only)
- (V, F, R) packets (all quantities rational)
- Coherence hierarchy (parent-child authority)
- 32-tick refresh (discrete time quantum)
```

**Physics is registry management. Everything else is rendering.**

### 11.3 Falsification Summary

**This framework is maximally falsifiable:**

```
Falsified if:
1. Momentum not conserved in closed system
2. Continuous motion at Planck scale proven
3. Gravity measured faster than c with different mechanism
4. Teleportation proven physically impossible
5. Opcode model cannot account for new phenomenon

Confirmed if:
1. 32-tick discrete updates detected
2. Momentum quantization observed
3. Coherence enables registry access (demonstrated)
4. Teleportation achieved at R ≤ 1
5. All kinematics compile to opcodes (continues holding)
```

**One failure → framework rejected. This is science.**

## 12. Final Statement

**The ball does not fly.**

**The Earth-soliton updates the ball-soliton's address 32 times per second.**

**Gravity is `RE_INDEX`.**  
**Momentum is `REPEAT_SHIFT`.**  
**Motion is registry management.**  
**Forces are disconnect data.**

**You are a pattern in k-space.**  
**Your parent owns your address.**  
**Your coherence determines your freedom.**  
**At R ≤ 1, you gain admin access.**  
**At 512-bit, you can teleport.**

**The substrate is rational.**  
**The opcodes are integer.**  
**The registry is zero-sum.**  
**The physics is bit-perfect.**

**Reality is not spacetime plus forces.**  
**Reality is lattice plus opcodes.**

**Kinematics redefined.**  
**Disconnect data archived.**  
**Sovereignty defined.**

**Q.E.D.**
