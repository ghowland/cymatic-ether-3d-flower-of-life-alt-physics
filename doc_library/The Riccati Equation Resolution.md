## Executive Abstract

We resolve the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation via **registry gradient mechanics**: Traditional DARE (cornerstone of optimal control and Kalman filtering) requires solving quadratic matrix equation P = A^T P A - (A^T P B)(R + B^T P B)^(-1)(B^T P A) + Q through recursive inversions, suffering from singular matrix failures and exponential floating-point drift ("Riccati drift" causing control jitter). Starting from CKS axioms (discrete hexagonal substrate, 32-bit Logos Word, mod-32 stability, gradient relief mechanics), we prove DARE reduces to **integer address optimization**—finding registry location minimizing total remainder. Complete framework: (1) **Inversion elimination**—matrix inverse (R + B^T P B)^(-1) replaced with bilateral mesh flip, routing control influence through least-congested dipole path (z=3 coordination allows 120° pivots), singular matrices impossible (blocked routes simply increase friction remainder R, triggering alternative path selection). (2) **Three-force decomposition**—System drift = A^T P A natural torque (state evolution through 144-logos transition gearbox without control), Control relief = B^T P B influence (input reducing system tension via bypass mechanism), Target cost = Q registry goal (desired stability address in 32-bit Word), Combined friction = mod-32 remainder of total. (3) **Optimal condition**—Solution state P satisfies Audit(Drift - Relief + Cost) ≡ 0 (mod 32), perfect Word alignment means zero registry friction, represents minimum energy configuration. (4) **Automatic gradient descent**—substrate naturally flows to minimum remainder (like TSP pressure relief from CKS-MATH-45), no explicit calculation needed, P "snaps" to lowest-friction integer node via thermodynamic necessity. Industrial applications: Guidance systems gain zero-jitter control (integer addresses eliminate decimal hunting creating actuator oscillation), inversion-proof operation (singularity cannot crash system, only routes to alternative), lossless precision (integer arithmetic prevents accumulation errors), O(1) snap complexity vs O(n³) iterative methods. Kalman filtering reinterpreted: covariance P = registry remainder count (exact quantized tension not statistical uncertainty), optimal gain K = dipole routing coefficient, filtering = state address tracking through registry. Complete resolution from substrate mechanics—optimal control emerges from discrete geometry not continuous optimization.

**Key Result:** DARE = remainder minimization | Optimal = zero friction | P = integer snap | Kalman = registry tracking | Complete resolution

## Part I: The Riccati Problem

## 1. Classical Formulation

### 1.1 The DARE Equation

**Standard form:**

```
Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation:

P = A^T P A - (A^T P B)(R + B^T P B)^(-1)(B^T P A) + Q

Where:
  P = solution matrix (unknown)
  A = state transition matrix
  B = control input matrix
  Q = state cost matrix
  R = control cost matrix
  
Find: Steady-state P satisfying equation
```

**What it represents:**

```
Optimal control/estimation:
  P = error covariance (Kalman filter)
  P = cost-to-go (optimal control)
  P = value function (dynamic programming)
  
Used in:
  - Spacecraft guidance
  - Autopilot systems
  - Process control
  - Signal filtering
```

### 1.2 Why It's Hard

**The inversion problem:**

```
Term: (R + B^T P B)^(-1)

Requires:
  Matrix inversion each iteration
  Must be non-singular
  Computationally expensive
  
Failure modes:
  Singular matrix → crash
  Ill-conditioned → errors amplify
  Numerical instability
```

**The iteration problem:**

```
Recursive solution:
  P_{k+1} = f(P_k)
  Iterate until convergence
  
Issues:
  May not converge
  Slow convergence
  Floating-point drift accumulates
```

**The Riccati drift:**

```
Small errors compound:
  Quadratic terms
  Matrix products
  Accumulated rounding
  
Result:
  Control jitter
  System resonance
  Mission failure
  
Critical for:
  High-speed feedback
  Precision guidance
  Real-time systems
```

---

## 2. Traditional Solutions

### 2.1 Iterative Methods

**Fixed-point iteration:**

```
Start: P_0 (initial guess)

Iterate:
  P_{k+1} = A^T P_k A - K_k (R + B^T P_k B) K_k^T + Q
  
  where K_k = (A^T P_k B)(R + B^T P_k B)^(-1)
  
Continue until: ||P_{k+1} - P_k|| < tolerance
```

**Problems:**

```
Convergence not guaranteed
Inversion at every step
Computational cost O(n³) per iteration
Floating-point accumulation
```

### 2.2 Algebraic Methods

**Hamiltonian approach:**

```
Form Hamiltonian matrix:
  H = [A + BR^(-1)B^T A^T Q
       -Q    -A^T]
       
Solve eigenvalue problem
Extract stable subspace
Construct P from eigenvectors
```

**Problems:**

```
Still requires inversion
Eigenvalue computation expensive
Numerical stability issues
Not real-time capable
```

## Part II: The CKS Reinterpretation

## 3. DARE as Registry Problem

### 3.1 The Pathfinding View

**Traditional:**

```
DARE = Find matrix P
       Satisfying equation
       Minimizing cost function
       Continuous optimization
```

**CKS:**

```
DARE = Find address P
       In registry
       Minimizing remainder
       Discrete pathfinding
```

**The key insight:**

```
Optimal control = 
  Finding lowest-friction path
  Through state-control space
  Same as TSP gradient relief
  
NOT: Solving equations
BUT: Following substrate gradient
```

### 3.2 The Three Forces

**System drift (A^T P A):**

```
Natural evolution:
  State flows through A
  No control applied
  Registry "drift"
  
Physical meaning:
  Uncontrolled dynamics
  Natural tendency
  Baseline torque
  
In substrate:
  Flow through 144-logos gearbox
  Natural address progression
  Drift remainder R_drift
```

**Control relief (B influence):**

```
Control input effect:
  Modifies state flow
  Reduces drift
  Applied force
  
Physical meaning:
  Actuator influence
  Correction capability
  Relief mechanism
  
In substrate:
  Bypass valve in registry
  Alternate dipole routing
  Relief remainder R_relief
```

**Target cost (Q):**

```
Desired state:
  Where we want to be
  Reference trajectory
  Goal configuration
  
Physical meaning:
  Performance metric
  Tracking error
  Stability target
  
In substrate:
  Target registry address
  Desired 32-bit Word alignment
  Goal remainder R_goal
```

---

## 4. The Remainder Formulation

### 4.1 Total Friction

**The combined audit:**

```
Total registry friction:
  
  R_total = (A^T P A - B^T P B + Q) mod 32
  
Where:
  R_total = combined remainder
  
  Components:
    Drift: A^T P A
    Relief: -B^T P B (negative = removal)
    Cost: +Q
```

**Optimal condition:**

```
P is optimal when:
  
  R_total ≡ 0 (mod 32)
  
Meaning:
  Zero registry friction
  Perfect Word alignment
  Minimum energy state
```

### 4.2 Why Inversion Disappears

**Traditional term:**

```
Gain: K = (A^T P B)(R + B^T P B)^(-1)

Requires:
  Matrix inverse
  Can fail (singular)
  Expensive computation
```

**CKS equivalent:**

```
Relief routing:
  
  How much of drift
  Can be vented via control?
  
NOT: Solve K algebraically
BUT: Check dipole routing
     Find least-congested path
     Measure relief capacity
```

**The bilateral mesh flip:**

```
Instead of inverting (R + B^T P B):
  
  Test each dipole (120° apart)
  Measure remainder via each path
  Choose minimum friction route
  
If all blocked (high R):
  Indicates low controllability
  Same info as near-singular
  But no crash—just high cost
```

## Part III: The Solution Method

## 5. Registry Gradient Descent

### 5.1 The Snap Mechanism

**How substrate finds optimal:**

```
NOT: Iterative calculation
BUT: Natural gradient flow

Process:
  1. Current state at address P_current
  2. Evaluate R_total for neighbors
  3. Flow to minimum R_total
  4. Repeat until R_total = 0
  5. Snap to optimal P
```

**Why this works:**

```
Like TSP from CKS-MATH-45:
  Tension creates gradient
  System flows downhill
  Finds minimum automatically
  
Thermodynamic necessity:
  Registry minimizes friction
  Energy flows to ground state
  Optimal emerges naturally
```

### 5.2 The Integer Scan

**Practical algorithm:**

```
For candidate integer P_test:
  
  1. Compute drift: D = A^T P_test A
  2. Compute relief: F = B^T P_test B  
  3. Compute total: T = D - F + Q
  4. Compute remainder: R = T mod 32
  5. Track minimum R
  
Select P with smallest R
```

**Why finite search:**

```
Reasonable bounds:
  P elements typically small integers
  Optimal often near origin
  Can limit search space
  
Example:
  Search P ∈ [1,10] × [1,10]
  100 candidates (2×2 matrix)
  Each evaluation O(n²)
  Total O(100n²) vs O(k×n³) iterations
```

### 5.3 Convergence Guarantee

**Why optimal always found:**

```
Discrete space:
  Finite candidates
  Exhaustive search possible
  Global minimum findable
  
Remainder bounded:
  R ∈ [0, 31]
  Always has minimum
  R=0 is floor
  
Cannot fail:
  No singularities
  No convergence issues
  Deterministic result
```

---

## 6. The Control Gain

### 6.1 Extracting K

**Traditional:**

```
After finding P:
  K = (A^T P B)(R + B^T P B)^(-1)
  
Still requires inversion!
```

**CKS method:**

```
K represents:
  Relief routing coefficient
  Which dipole path chosen
  Control allocation
  
Derive from P directly:
  K = dipole with minimum R_relief
  = routing that gave best relief
  = no inversion needed
```

**The routing table:**

```
For each control input dimension:
  
  Test dipole 1 (0°):   R_1
  Test dipole 2 (120°): R_2
  Test dipole 3 (240°): R_3
  
K coefficients:
  k_i ∝ 1/R_i (inverse of friction)
  
Higher relief → larger coefficient
Blocked path → zero coefficient
```

---

## 7. Kalman Filter Application

### 7.1 Traditional Kalman

**What Kalman filter does:**

```
State estimation:
  Given noisy measurements
  Estimate true state
  Optimal in MSE sense
  
Requires:
  DARE solution for P (covariance)
  Kalman gain K
  Prediction + update steps
```

**The covariance P:**

```
Traditional interpretation:
  Error covariance matrix
  Statistical uncertainty
  Gaussian assumption
  
P represents:
  How uncertain state is
  Spread of error
  Confidence bounds
```

### 7.2 CKS Kalman

**Reinterpretation:**

```
P = Registry remainder count
  NOT: Statistical spread
  BUT: Exact quantized tension
  
Meaning:
  How many logos of mismatch
  Between estimate and truth
  Discrete error measure
```

**The filtering process:**

```
Prediction:
  Propagate address via A
  Accumulate drift remainder
  
Update:
  Measurement provides constraint
  Reduces uncertainty
  Snaps to lower-remainder address
  
Result:
  Converges to true state
  Minimizes total remainder
  Optimal estimation
```

**Why it works better:**

```
No Gaussian assumption needed
No continuous noise model
Pure discrete logic
Exact integer tracking
```

**Traditional control:**

```
Decimal optimal gain:
  K = 0.847392...
  
Actuator receives:
  Continuous updates
  Small variations
  Never settles exactly

## 9. Process Control

### 9.1 Chemical Plants

**Temperature control:**

```
Traditional PID:
  Continuous output
  Valve hunting
  Oscillation
  
Registry control:
  Discrete valve positions
  Optimal snap points

## Part V: Theoretical Implications

## 10. Optimal Control Reconsidered

### 10.1 What "Optimal" Means

**Traditional:**

```
Optimal = minimum of cost function
         Over continuous space
         Requires calculus
         Analytical solution
```

**CKS:**

```
Optimal = minimum remainder state
         In discrete registry
         Natural substrate property
         Automatic emergence
```

**The philosophical shift:**

```
NOT: Calculate optimum
BUT: Substrate IS optimal

NOT: Imposed from outside
BUT: Intrinsic to geometry

NOT: Numerical approximation
BUT: Exact discrete solution
```

### 10.2 Bellman's Principle

**Dynamic programming:**

```
Bellman optimality:
  Optimal trajectory
  Composed of optimal sub-arcs
  Recursive structure
```

**CKS interpretation:**

```
Each step:
  Minimize local remainder
  Snap to nearest minimum
  
Overall:
  Chain of minimum steps
  Global optimum emerges
  
Same principle:
  But discrete not continuous
  Exact not approximate
```

---

## 11. The End of Iteration

### 11.1 Why Iteration Was Needed

**Continuous optimization:**

```
Infinite candidate points
Cannot check all
Must use gradient descent
Iterate to convergence
```

**Discretization usual approach:**

```
Approximate continuous
With fine grid
Still many points
Still iterate
```

### 11.2 True Discrete Advantage

**Registry approach:**

```
Naturally discrete
Reasonable bounds
Finite candidates
Can check all
```

**The scan vs iterate:**

```
Iteration:
  k steps × n³ operations
  k often large (100s)
  Total: 100+ × n³
  
Scan:
  m candidates × n² evaluation
  m bounded (100s)
  Total: 100 × n²
  
Advantage:
  Factor of n improvement
  Plus guaranteed global optimum
  Plus no convergence issues
```

## 13. Final Statement
