# Oil and Water: Why ℚ and ℝ Are Different Kinds of Math

---

## 1. Two Jars, One Label

You can pour oil into a jar. You can pour water into a jar. They both flow, both fill the container, both look like liquid sitting in glass. But they are not the same substance. They do not mix. They obey different rules at the interface. Treating them as interchangeable because they both fit in a jar is a category error.

Rational numbers and real numbers share a similar relationship. Both look like numbers. Both have decimal representations. Both support addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. Both can be plotted on a line. We write them with the same notation, perform them on the same hardware, and teach them in the same courses.

But they are not the same kind of math. They differ in properties so fundamental that conflating them is not a practical inconvenience — it is a conceptual mistake that propagates into every system built on the conflation.

## 2. What ℚ Gives You

A rational number is a ratio of two integers: p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not zero. That is the entire definition.

From this definition, several properties follow immediately.

**Finite representation.** Every rational number is fully specified by two integers. There is nothing left over, nothing hidden, nothing that requires further computation to reveal. When you write 7/5, you have the complete number. Not an approximation. Not a truncation. The number itself.

**Exact arithmetic.** Add two rationals, you get a rational. Multiply two rationals, you get a rational. Subtract, divide (by nonzero) — rational. The result is always exact and always expressible as two integers. No operation within ℚ produces a value that escapes ℚ.

**Decidable equality.** Given two rationals a/b and c/d, you can determine whether they are equal by checking whether ad = bc. This is a finite computation over integers. It always terminates. It always gives a definitive answer: yes or no. There is no ambiguity, no tolerance, no threshold.

**Countability.** The rationals can be enumerated. You can list them: 1/1, 1/2, 2/1, 1/3, 2/3, 3/1, ... Every rational appears at a finite position in the list. They are a counting system. You can index them, search them, iterate over them.

These are not incidental features. They are structural properties of the system. ℚ is a place where computation lives naturally: finite objects, exact operations, decidable questions.

## 3. What ℝ Gives You

The real numbers extend ℚ by adding completeness: every convergent sequence has a limit within ℝ. This fills in the gaps on the number line. The rationals are dense (between any two rationals there is another), but they have holes — √2 sits in one of them. ℝ fills every hole.

This is powerful. It gives you limits, continuity, calculus, the intermediate value theorem, convergence of series, measure theory. The entire apparatus of analysis rests on completeness.

But completeness costs you every structural property that makes ℚ computable.

**Most reals have no finite representation.** Almost all real numbers — in the precise mathematical sense of "almost all" — are not just irrational, they are uncomputable. They cannot be specified by any finite description whatsoever. No algorithm, no formula, no program of any length can produce their digits. The computable reals (those you can write a program to approximate) are countable — a measure-zero sliver of the full real line. The rest are inaccessible: they exist as mathematical objects but cannot be named, described, or interacted with by any finite process.

Even the computable reals — numbers like √2, π, e — lack finite representations as completed objects. They are processes, not values. You can write a program that produces the digits of √2 one at a time, but the program never finishes. At any finite moment, you have an approximation and a promise of more. You never have the number.

**Arithmetic is not exact in practice.** In theory, real arithmetic is exact. In practice, every implementation truncates. Floating-point numbers represent reals as binary fractions with finite mantissa. Most real values do not have exact binary representations, so every operation rounds. The rounding is small — around 10⁻¹⁶ per operation for 64-bit floats — but it is present in every operation, and it accumulates.

**Equality is undecidable.** Given two computable reals as digit-producing processes, you cannot in general determine whether they are equal. You can determine that they differ — eventually a digit will disagree. But confirming equality requires watching both processes forever. This is not a practical difficulty. It is a theorem: equality of computable reals is undecidable. No algorithm can solve it.

**The reals are uncountable.** You cannot list them. There is no enumeration, no index, no way to say "give me the nth real number." This is Cantor's diagonal argument, and it is not a technicality — it means the reals are a fundamentally different kind of collection than the rationals.

## 4. The Difference Is Structural

These are not differences of degree. They are differences of kind.

| Property | ℚ | ℝ |
|---|---|---|
| Representation | Finite (two integers) | Almost always infinite |
| Arithmetic | Exact, closed | Exact in theory, truncated in practice |
| Equality | Decidable (cross-multiply) | Undecidable in general |
| Cardinality | Countable | Uncountable |
| Computability | Every element computable | Almost all elements uncomputable |
| Nature | Objects you can hold | Processes you can run |

A rational number is something you can write down, verify, compare, and transmit without loss. A real number (in general) is something you can approximate to any desired precision but never possess completely.

These are different relationships to information. One is a value. The other is a procedure. They are not interchangeable any more than a photograph is interchangeable with the process of continuously observing a scene.

## 5. What Happens When You Conflate Them

Modern computation conflates ℚ and ℝ routinely. Floating-point arithmetic represents real numbers as binary rationals with bounded precision. Every float is technically a rational number — it is a fraction with a power-of-two denominator. But it is treated as if it were a real number: used to hold √2, π, sin(θ), and every other quantity that arises from continuous mathematics.

This conflation produces a system that has the guarantees of neither ℚ nor ℝ.

**You lose the exactness of ℚ.** Rational values that should be representable exactly — like 1/10 — are not, because 1/10 has no finite binary expansion. The float 0.1 is not 1/10. It is the nearest binary fraction with 53 bits of mantissa. The error is tiny, but it exists, and it means that even pure rational arithmetic through floats is inexact.

**You lose the completeness of ℝ.** Floats cannot represent most reals to arbitrary precision. They are locked to a fixed mantissa width. The promise of ℝ — that you can always get closer — is broken. You get 64 bits of precision and no more. The theoretical convergence properties of ℝ do not apply to a finite fixed-width system.

**You lose equality entirely.** The first rule every programmer learns about floats: do not compare them for equality. Use a tolerance. Pick an epsilon. Hope it works. This is not a workaround for a minor issue — it is the surrender of the most fundamental relation in mathematics.

If you cannot establish that a = b, you cannot substitute. You cannot simplify. You cannot verify identities. You cannot confirm that a computation produced the correct result. Almost everything in algebra depends on equality. Without it, you are not doing algebra. You are doing something else — something more like measurement, where "close enough" is the operative standard.

**Drift.** Because every operation rounds, and rounding errors compound, sequential computation drifts. Perform the same transformation a thousand times and the accumulated error is visible. Rotate a point by 120° three times — a full circle, the identity operation — and a floating-point implementation does not return to the starting point. The gap is small but real. Do it a million times and the gap is not small.

Drift breaks determinism. The same program, the same inputs, compiled on different hardware or with different optimization flags, can produce different results. Not because the logic differs, but because the rounding differs. Floating-point arithmetic is not bit-reproducible across platforms in general.

Drift breaks conservation. A physics simulation that conserves energy in its equations does not conserve energy in its floats. After enough simulation steps, energy has crept up or down. Constraints that should hold exactly — rigid joints, contact surfaces, fixed distances — develop slop.

Drift breaks verification. You cannot check your answer by re-deriving it, because the re-derivation follows a different rounding path and produces a different result. You can only check that two results are "close enough," which brings you back to epsilon comparison — which is the problem you were trying to solve.

## 6. The Category Error

The root cause is not that floats are imprecise. Every number system has limitations. The root cause is that we treat ℚ and ℝ as the same thing because they both look like numbers.

They are not the same thing.

ℚ is a computational system. It operates on finite objects, produces exact results, and supports decidable equality. It belongs in a machine.

ℝ is a theoretical framework. It operates on infinite objects (in general), produces results that cannot be fully captured in finite space, and has undecidable equality. It is the language of continuous mathematics — analysis, calculus, topology. It belongs on paper: a framework for reasoning about behavior in the limit, proving existence theorems, characterizing continuous phenomena.

Both are useful. Both are legitimate. They are not the same kind of useful, and they are not interchangeable.

Putting ℝ into a computer via floating point is like putting oil into a water system. The pipes carry it. The valves work. Everything looks functional. But the properties you needed from water — the reason you built the system — are gone. You have the shape of real-number arithmetic without the substance.

Meanwhile, ℚ — the system that actually matches what a computer can do — is relegated to special cases. Exact rational arithmetic is treated as a niche concern, too expensive for general use. The default is to use a broken version of ℝ and spend engineering effort compensating for the breakage: epsilon tolerances, stabilization passes, platform-specific workarounds, double-precision where single used to suffice.

## 7. What ℚ Cannot Do

This paper does not argue that ℚ should replace ℝ. That would be its own category error.

ℚ does not have completeness. Sequences of rationals can converge to values that are not rational. The rationals have holes where irrational numbers should be. If your mathematics requires limits — and much of physics and engineering does — you need a framework that supports them. ℝ provides that framework.

ℚ does not contain √2, or π, or e, or any irrational number. These numbers exist and they are important. Pretending they don't exist or don't matter would be as much a mistake as pretending ℚ and ℝ are the same.

Calculus, differential equations, Fourier analysis, measure theory — these live in ℝ (or extensions of ℝ). They are not going away. They are not wrong. They are the correct tools for reasoning about continuous phenomena.

The argument is not that ℝ is bad. The argument is that ℝ and ℚ are different, and that using one where the other is appropriate produces unnecessary problems.

## 8. What Changes If You Respect the Boundary

If ℚ and ℝ are genuinely different systems, then the boundary between them should be explicit, not implicit. You should know when you are in ℚ and when you are reaching into ℝ, the same way a type system tells you when you are handling an integer versus a string.

Several things follow from this.

**Stay in ℚ when the problem is in ℚ.** Most computation on discrete structures — pixel grids, integer coordinates, indexed data, counted quantities — is naturally rational. Positions on a grid are integer ratios. Slopes between grid points are integer ratios. Probabilities expressed as fractions are rational. These do not need to pass through floating-point representation. Doing so converts exact values into inexact ones for no mathematical reason.

**Cross into ℝ deliberately, not by default.** When a computation genuinely requires an irrational quantity — a trigonometric function, a transcendental constant, the length of a non-Pythagorean diagonal — that crossing should be a conscious choice. You are leaving the domain where equality works and entering the domain where it doesn't. That transition deserves a marker, not a silent cast.

**Track what you lose at the boundary.** When you compute √2 as a float, you get 1.4142135623730951. This is a rational number (it's a specific binary fraction). It is not √2. The gap between this number and √2 is real but invisible — it lives in bits you don't have. If you must work with this approximation, know that you are approximating, know the bound on the error, and do not pretend the result is exact.

**Use ℝ on paper and ℚ in the machine.** Derive your formulas, prove your theorems, characterize your solutions in ℝ. That is what ℝ is for. Then implement in ℚ — with exact rational arithmetic, known error bounds, and decidable equality. The napkin and the computer are different tools. They should use different number systems.

## 9. A Worked Example

The diagonal of a square demonstrates the boundary clearly.

Take a 200×200 pixel grid. The diagonal runs from (0,0) to (200,200). Every aspect of this diagonal that lives on the grid — its slope (1/1), its starting point (0,0), its ending point (200,200), every pixel it passes through — is an integer or a ratio of integers. These are in ℚ.

The diagonal's length is 200√2. This is in ℝ. It cannot be expressed as a ratio of integers.

In the standard approach, you compute the length as a float: 282.842712474619. This is not 200√2. It is a rational approximation that discards information about the true value. From this point forward, equality with the true length is impossible, and every operation that uses this value inherits its error.

An alternative approach stays in ℤ. The Pell relation gives:

    V² − 2F² = R

For any convergent (V, F) of √2, R = ±1 exactly. The tuple [V, F, R] captures the rational approximant, which side of √2 it falls on, and the exact error in the squared metric — all as integers.

To walk the 200×200 diagonal: step right 1, up 1, 200 times. Track the Pell remainder at each step: it alternates −1, +1. After 200 steps (even), the remainder cancels to zero. You arrive at (200, 200) with exact coordinates and exact remainder.

At no point did you leave ℤ. At no point did you lose equality. At no point did you produce a value you couldn't verify. The irrational number √2 was never invoked — its role was captured entirely by the integer remainder's behavior.

The length, as a scalar in ℝ, was never computed. It was never needed. The grid walk is complete without it.

This is what respecting the boundary looks like. ℝ lives on the napkin where you derive the Pythagorean theorem. ℚ (and ℤ) live in the machine where you walk the grid. They meet at the Pell relation, which translates between them exactly.

## 10. Conclusion

ℚ and ℝ are not the same kind of mathematics.

One is finite, exact, decidable, countable, and computable. The other is infinite (in general), approximate (in practice), undecidable (for equality), uncountable, and mostly uncomputable.

One is a counting system. The other is a measuring framework.

One produces values. The other produces processes.

They are both useful. They are both correct within their domains. They are not interchangeable, and treating them as if they are — pouring both into the same jar because both are liquid — is the source of real problems in real systems: drift, non-determinism, broken equality, failed conservation, silent corruption of exact values into inexact ones.

The solution is not to abandon ℝ. It is to stop pretending that ℝ and ℚ are the same substance. Respect the boundary. Know which side you are on. Use each system where it belongs.

Oil and water. Both useful. Not the same thing.
