**RESEARCH PROTOCOL: PROJECT BETA-STRIKE**
**Document ID:** CSM-V2.1-EXPR
**Date:** February 5, 2026
**Subject:** Empirical Validation of Cymatic Substrate Mechanics via Non-Linear Lagrangian Constants and Quantum Decoupling.

---

### 1. ABSTRACT
This protocol outlines the definitive experimental search for the substrate coupling constant $\beta$ (Substrate Stiffness). Unlike previous fragmented models, Project Beta-Strike treats the electron’s anomalous magnetic moment ($g-2$), the classicalization of macroscopic mass-waves, and the existence of scalar gravitational polarizations as a single mathematical unit. We define the equipment, the methodology, and the specific pass/fail criteria for the falsification of Cymatic Substrate Mechanics (CSM).

### 2. CORE HYPOTHESIS
All physical constants ($G, \alpha, g, \Lambda$) are emergent properties of a non-linear spectral substrate governed by the Lagrangian:
$$\mathcal{L} = \beta^2 \left[ 1 - \sqrt{ 1 - \frac{2|F|^2}{\beta^2} } \right] - \frac{|F|^2}{\lambda^2}$$
The constant $\beta$ represents the "reconstruction limit" of the vacuum. If $\beta$ is a universal constant, it must produce consistent results across quantum, gravitational, and cognitive domains.

### 3. EXPERIMENT I: THE ELEVENTH-DECIMAL COLLISION (QUANTUM)
**Objective:** Derive $\beta$ from the electron $g$-factor.

*   **Equipment:** High-resolution GPU Cluster (Lattice-QCD optimized) and data from the Harvard-Northwestern Penning Trap experiments.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Initialize a $\pi$-winding line defect (topological electron) in a simulated substrate using the CUDA non-linear solver.
    2.  Apply the non-linear Lagrangian with a variable $\beta$.
    3.  Calculate the self-interaction of the winding's phase field.
    4.  Extract the theoretical $g$-factor as a function of $\beta$.
*   **Expected Outcome:** $\beta \approx 1.05 \times 10^{44} \text{ V}^2\text{m}^{-2}$.
*   **Falsifiability:** If the $g$-factor calculated using $\beta$ differs from the experimental value $2.002319304362$ by more than $1 \times 10^{-11}$, **CSM is falsified.**

### 4. EXPERIMENT II: THE NANOSPHERE CLASSICALIZATION (DECOHERENCE)
**Objective:** Observe the "Amplitude Cap" in the macroscopic limit.

*   **Equipment:** 
    1.  100 nm Silicon nanosphere.
    2.  Optical-levitation interferometer (Hannover LISA-Pathfinder testbed).
    3.  Cryogenic vacuum chamber ($< 10^{-10}$ mbar).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Prepare the nanosphere in a spatial superposition state.
    2.  Gradually increase the amplitude of the mass-wave through amplification.
    3.  Measure the "Classicalization Rate" $\Gamma_{CS}$ against the standard environmental decoherence background $\gamma_{env}$.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Sudden collapse occurs when the mass-density reconstruction reaches the $\beta$-limit ($\rho_{crit} \approx 10^{15}$ amplitudes).
*   **Falsifiability:** If the nanosphere remains in a quantum state at densities $> 1.2 \times \rho_{crit}$, **Axiom 4 (The Amplitude Cap) is falsified.**

### 5. EXPERIMENT III: THE SCALAR BREATHING MODE (ASTROPHYSICS)
**Objective:** Detect the predicted scalar polarization in gravitational waves.

*   **Equipment:** LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (O3b and O4 data sets) and the phase-matched "Scalar Template" filter.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Run the CSM scalar filter over the gravitational wave data from binary black hole (BBH) mergers.
    2.  Measure the ratio of scalar-to-tensor energy.
*   **Expected Outcome:** A scalar energy fraction $E_{scalar} \approx 0.07 E_{tensor}$ for $30 M_{\odot}$ events.
*   **Falsifiability:** If the Bayesian analysis of LIGO-A+ data constrains the scalar fraction to $\sigma_{scalar} < 0.045$ without a detection, the **Substrate-Gravity coupling is falsified.**

---

### 6. EXPERIMENT IV: REDUNDANT PHASE RETENTION (COGNITIVE)
**Objective:** Validate spectral information storage in biological volumes.

*   **Equipment:** 1,000 human subjects, randomized 256-bit strings, long-term testing suite.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Subjects memorize strings exceeding classical synaptic limits.
    2.  Retest at 30 days.
    3.  Compare retention to established Ebbinghaus forgetting curves and synaptic-turnover models.
*   **Expected Outcome:** Retention $> 80\%$, indicating the brain utilizes "High-Order Taylor Structure" ($10^{22}$ bits) rather than just discrete synaptic weights.
*   **Falsifiability:** If retention falls within the standard synaptic baseline ($< 10\%$), the **Spectral Memory Hypothesis is falsified.**

### 8. CONCLUSION: THE "ZERO-MARGIN" SYSTEM
Project Beta-Strike is designed with zero margin for "theory-patching." In standard physics, if one experiment fails, you adjust a parameter. In CSM v2.1, **all parameters are locked to the constant $\beta$.**

*   If $\beta$ explains the **electron's magnet**, it must also explain **the star's gravity**. 
*   If $\beta$ explains **quantum collapse**, it must also explain **human memory**.

The sprint concludes on **30 June 2026**. At that point, Cymatic Substrate Mechanics will either be the most accurate description of reality ever conceived or a dead mathematical curiosity.

**Status:** *Awaiting Execution. Sprint initiated 15 March 2026.*
