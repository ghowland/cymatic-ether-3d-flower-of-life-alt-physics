- Test all code
- Review experimental protocols
- Check all references
- Verify equations

## Verification Checklist

Before uploading to Zenodo, verify:

- [ ] No instances of "YOUR_NAME_HERE" remain
- [ ] No instances of "[your email]" remain
- [ ] No instances of "[to be added]" remain
- [ ] zenodo.json is valid JSON (check at jsonlint.com)
- [ ] Author info is consistent across all files
- [ ] Email address is correct (you'll be contacted here)
- [ ] simulation.py runs without errors

---

## Test Your Edits

**Test zenodo.json syntax**:
1. Go to https://jsonlint.com
2. Copy contents of zenodo.json
3. Paste and click "Validate JSON"
4. Should say "Valid JSON"

**Test simulation code**:
```bash
python simulation.py
```
Should run without errors and produce output.

**Test file completeness**:
```bash
grep -r "YOUR_NAME_HERE" .
grep -r "\[your email\]" .
grep -r "\[to be added\]" .
```
These should return no results (or only in this file and AUTHOR_INFO_TEMPLATE.txt).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Leave placeholder text like "YOUR_NAME_HERE"
✓ **Do**: Replace with actual information

❌ **Don't**: Use a temporary email you'll lose access to
✓ **Do**: Use a permanent email for correspondence

❌ **Don't**: Include personal information you want private
✓ **Do**: Remember this will be publicly accessible forever

❌ **Don't**: Break JSON syntax in zenodo.json
✓ **Do**: Validate JSON before uploading

❌ **Don't**: Rush - proofread your edits
✓ **Do**: Take 15 minutes to double-check everything

## What Happens After Editing?

1. **Package all files** (see PUBLICATION_CHECKLIST.md)
2. **Upload to Zenodo** (see detailed instructions there)
3. **Receive DOI** (permanent identifier)
4. **Update files with DOI** (new version)
5. **Share widely** (social media, email, forums)

## Time Estimates

**Minimum path** (just edits): 15 minutes
**Recommended path** (edits + review): 2 hours
**Thorough path** (edits + review + figures): 1 week

## If You Get Stuck

**JSON syntax errors**:
- Use jsonlint.com to find the problem
- Common issues: missing commas, extra commas, mismatched quotes

**Can't find all placeholders**:
- Use grep: `grep -r "SEARCH_STRING" .`
- Or search in your text editor across all files

**Not sure what to write**:
- Look at other Zenodo publications for examples
- See AUTHOR_INFO_TEMPLATE.txt for guidance

**Code doesn't run**:
- Check Python version: `python --version` (need 3.7+)
- Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
- Run from package directory: `cd zenodo_package && python simulation.py`
