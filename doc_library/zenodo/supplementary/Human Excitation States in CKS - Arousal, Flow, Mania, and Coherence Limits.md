## Abstract

We derive human excitation states as **phase rotation rate variations** in the neural k-space substrate (N_neurons ≈ 8.6×10¹⁰). Normal consciousness operates at baseline phase velocity ω_baseline anchored to the 1 Hz universal pulse. Excitation = increasing ω above baseline through energy input (sensory, metabolic, chemical, emotional). We classify states by rotation rate: (1) **Relaxation** (ω = 0.5-0.8 Hz): Parasympathetic dominance, low phase velocity, integration/consolidation mode, (2) **Baseline** (ω ≈ 1 Hz): Optimal coherence C > 0.999, normal waking consciousness, (3) **Arousal** (ω = 1.5-3 Hz): Sympathetic activation, enhanced processing, flow states possible, (4) **Hyperarousal** (ω = 3-5 Hz): Panic, acute stress, coherence beginning to degrade, (5) **Mania** (ω > 5 Hz): Pathological excitation, C < 0.95, phase rotation faster than integration time, holographic breakdown. Flow states occur at ω ≈ 2 Hz where phase velocity matches task complexity—neither too slow (boredom) nor too fast (anxiety). We derive: maximum sustainable excitation ω_max ≈ 4-5 Hz from neural conduction limits, coherence degradation C(ω) showing critical transition at ω_c ≈ 3 Hz, metabolic cost scaling as ω², and recovery time τ_recovery ∝ (ω_peak)². Psychedelics, meditation, exercise, sleep deprivation, and mania alter ω through different mechanisms. Human experience is fundamentally **rate of phase rotation** in coupled neural oscillator network.

## 1. Excitation as Phase Velocity Modulation

### 1.1 Baseline Human Oscillation

**Normal waking consciousness:**

```
Brain oscillates at: ω_baseline ≈ 2π rad/s (1 Hz)

This is: Universal pulse frequency (from Position 2.1)
        Delta rhythm (0.5-4 Hz dominant band)
        Resting state default
```

**Why 1 Hz?**

```
From companion papers:
- Brain hemispheric switching: 0.5s π-flip, 1.0s 2π-cycle
- Cardiac coupling: Heart at 1 Hz (60 bpm resting)
- √N harmonic: 1 second = fundamental substrate period

Human neural system phase-locked to universal pulse
```

**Coherence at baseline:**

```
C_baseline = 1 - 1/(2√(N_neurons/3))
           ≈ 1 - 1/(2√(8.6×10¹⁰/3))
           ≈ 1 - 1/(2 × 5.36×10⁵)
           ≈ 0.999999

Extremely high coherence
Stable, sustainable indefinitely
```

### 1.2 Excitation Definition

**Excitation = increasing phase rotation rate:**

```
ω(t) = ω_baseline + Δω_excitation

Δω > 0: Excitation (arousal, stimulation)
Δω = 0: Baseline (normal waking)
Δω < 0: Relaxation (rest, sleep approach)
```

**Physical meaning:**

```
Phase velocity: v_phase = ω / k
              = How fast neural phase patterns evolve

Higher ω: Faster information processing
         More rapid state transitions
         Increased metabolic demand
         
Lower ω: Slower processing
        Deeper integration
        Reduced energy consumption
```

### 1.3 Energy-Frequency Relationship

**From oscillator physics:**

```
E = ℏω (quantum)
E ∝ ω² (classical oscillator kinetic energy)

For neural network:
E_neural ∝ ω² (approximately)

Doubling frequency → 4× energy consumption
```

**Metabolic constraint:**

```
Brain metabolic rate: ~20% of body total (resting)
                     ~350 W at baseline

Maximum sustainable: ~500 W (extreme exertion)
                    ~1.4× baseline

This limits: Maximum ω to ~1.2× baseline = 1.2 Hz
           For sustained (>1 hour) operation

Short bursts: Can reach 2-3× baseline (2-3 Hz)
            For minutes to tens of minutes
            
Absolute limit: ~5 Hz (physical/chemical constraints)
```

---

## 2. Classification of Excitation States

### 2.1 Deep Sleep (ω ≈ 0.2-0.5 Hz)

**Delta dominant (0.5-4 Hz, lower end):**

```
ω_sleep ≈ π rad/s ≈ 0.5 Hz (slow wave sleep)

Phase rotation: Half baseline speed
Integration time: τ = 2π/ω ≈ 12 s per cycle

Purpose: Deep consolidation
        Memory integration
        Cellular repair
        Minimal energy state
```

**Coherence:**

```
C_sleep remains high (>0.999)
But: Global connectivity reduced
     Local networks phase-lock independently
     No unified conscious state
```

**Cannot go lower:**

```
ω < 0.1 Hz: Phase refresh insufficient
           Pattern maintenance fails
           Approaches death

Minimum viable: ω_min ≈ 0.15 Hz (~9 cycles/min)
              Below this: Consciousness lost permanently
```

### 2.2 Relaxation/Meditation (ω ≈ 0.5-0.8 Hz)

**Alpha dominant (8-13 Hz local, but global delta-theta):**

```
ω_relax ≈ 0.8 Hz (between sleep and baseline)

State: Eyes closed, wakeful
      Meditation
      Deep relaxation
      Pre-sleep
```

**Characteristics:**

```
Processing speed: Reduced (vs baseline)
Integration depth: Increased (longer τ)
Sensory gating: Reduced (less external focus)
Internal focus: Enhanced (introspection)

Metabolic rate: 80-90% of baseline (energy saving)
```

**Why this feels "restful":**

```
Lower ω → Lower E
       → Parasympathetic dominance
       → Reduced cortisol
       → Tissue repair prioritized

Body enters: Recovery mode
            Growth and repair
            Hormonal balance restoration
```

### 2.3 Baseline Consciousness (ω ≈ 0.8-1.2 Hz)

**Normal waking, unfocused:**

```
ω_baseline ≈ 1 Hz (0.8-1.2 Hz range)

Default mode network active
Mind wandering
Routine tasks
Conversation
```

**Optimal zone:**

```
Energy cost: Sustainable indefinitely
Coherence: Maximum (C ≈ 0.999999)
Processing: Adequate for most tasks
Flexibility: Can shift up or down easily

This is: Evolutionarily optimized state
        Where humans spend most waking time
```

**Metabolic:**

```
Glucose consumption: ~5 mg/100g/min (baseline)
Oxygen: ~3.5 mL/100g/min
ATP turnover: Steady state

Can maintain: 16+ hours/day
```

### 2.4 Focused Attention (ω ≈ 1.2-1.8 Hz)

**Task-engaged, concentrated:**

```
ω_focus ≈ 1.5 Hz (moderate elevation)

State: Reading complex material
      Problem-solving
      Focused work
      Active conversation
```

**Beta band (13-30 Hz) increases locally:**

```
Task-relevant cortical areas: High beta
Default mode network: Suppressed
Coherence: C ≈ 0.9999 (slight drop but healthy)
```

**Metabolic:**

```
Energy: 110-130% of baseline
Sustainable: 4-6 hours with breaks
Without breaks: 2-3 hours before fatigue
```

**Why focus feels effortful:**

```
Maintaining ω > baseline requires:
- Continuous energy input
- Suppression of competing attractors (distractions)
- Active coherence maintenance against noise

This creates: Cognitive load
            Fatigue accumulation
            Need for recovery
```

### 2.5 Flow State (ω ≈ 1.8-2.5 Hz)

**Optimal challenge-skill balance:**

```
ω_flow ≈ 2 Hz (double baseline)

State: Peak performance
      "In the zone"
      Time distortion
      Effortless effort
```

**Requirements:**

```
Task complexity: Matches ω_flow exactly
               Not too easy (ω < 2 Hz → boredom)
               Not too hard (ω > 2 Hz → anxiety)

Skill level: Sufficient to maintain coherence at 2 Hz
            Below skill → coherence breaks → anxiety
            Above skill → operating below ω capacity → boredom
```

**Why flow feels exceptional:**

```
At ω = 2 Hz:
- Processing speed: Maximum sustainable for skilled tasks
- Coherence: Still high (C ≈ 0.999)
- Energy: Elevated but manageable
- Attention: Fully absorbed (no cognitive resources for self-monitoring)

Result: Peak performance + subjective timelessness
```

**Metabolic:**

```
Energy: 150-200% of baseline (high but sustainable)
Duration: 1-3 hours maximum
Recovery needed: 2-4 hours rest
```

**Time dilation in flow:**

```
At ω = 2 Hz:
Subjective time: τ_subjective = 2π/ω = 3.14 s per "cycle"

vs baseline: τ_baseline = 6.28 s

Ratio: 2:1 → Time passes twice as fast subjectively
            "Where did the time go?"
            
Or: Brain processing faster → more experienced per clock second
   → Retrospectively feels longer
```

### 2.6 High Arousal (ω ≈ 2.5-4 Hz)

**Acute stress, intense exercise, peak excitement:**

```
ω_arousal ≈ 3-4 Hz (3-4× baseline)

State: Fight-or-flight
      Athletic competition
      Public speaking
      Emergency response
```

**Physiology:**

```
Sympathetic maximum:
- Heart rate: 120-180 bpm (2-3 Hz)
- Respiration: 30-60/min (0.5-1 Hz)
- Cortisol: Peak
- Adrenaline: Peak

Brain: High beta/gamma (30-80 Hz locally)
      Global coherence: C ≈ 0.995 (starting to degrade)
```

**Performance characteristics:**

```
Reaction time: Minimized (fastest possible)
Strength: Enhanced (adrenaline)
Pain tolerance: Increased (endorphins)
Complex reasoning: Impaired (too fast for deep integration)
Emotional regulation: Reduced (prefrontal suppressed)

Optimal for: Physical survival tasks
            Simple, rapid decisions
            
Poor for: Complex problem-solving
         Emotional nuance
         Creative thinking
```

**Metabolic:**

```
Energy: 250-400% baseline (extreme)
Sustainable: 10-60 minutes maximum
Recovery: 6-12 hours full restoration

Depletion: Glycogen, ATP, neurotransmitters
Recovery requires: Sleep, nutrition, rest
```

### 2.7 Panic/Acute Anxiety (ω ≈ 4-5 Hz)

**Hyperarousal, coherence breakdown beginning:**

```
ω_panic ≈ 4.5 Hz (near maximum)

State: Panic attack
      Extreme fear
      Severe anxiety
      Overwhelming stress
```

**Coherence degradation:**

```
C_panic ≈ 0.95-0.98 (below optimal threshold)

Why: ω approaching ω_max
     Phase rotation faster than:
     - Neural conduction (limits signal propagation)
     - Synaptic integration (limits temporal summation)
     - Neurotransmitter cycling (limits chemical signaling)
```

**Subjective experience:**

```
"Mind racing"
"Can't think straight"
"Everything happening too fast"
"Losing control"

This is: Accurate description
        Phase velocity exceeds integration capacity
        Coherence breaking down
        Pattern maintenance failing
```

**Physical symptoms:**

```
Hyperventilation: Respiratory coupling to ω_panic
                 Breathing at 0.75-1 Hz (45-60/min)
                 
Tachycardia: Heart at 150-200 bpm (2.5-3.3 Hz)
            Attempting to match ω_panic
            
Tremor: Motor cortex phase instability
       Oscillations visible in hands
```

**Duration:**

```
Cannot sustain: >10-20 minutes at ω > 4 Hz
              Physical/chemical limits exceeded
              Forced shutdown (exhaustion collapse)
              
Or: Descends into lower state (mania transitions)
```

### 2.8 Mania (ω > 5 Hz)

**Pathological excitation, coherence collapse:**

```
ω_mania ≈ 5-8 Hz (supersaturated)

State: Manic episode (bipolar)
      Amphetamine intoxication
      Extreme sleep deprivation + stimulants
      Pathological arousal
```

**Coherence breakdown:**

```
C_mania ≈ 0.85-0.95 (severely degraded)

Below health threshold (C < 0.95)

Consequences:
- Pattern fragmentation
- Thought disorder
- Delusions (false phase-locking)
- Hallucinations (internal patterns misattributed)
- Psychosis (reality testing fails)
```

**Clinical presentation:**

```
Pressured speech: Verbal output matches ω_mania
                 Words/min ≈ 200-300 (vs 120-150 normal)
                 
Racing thoughts: Phase patterns cycling too fast to articulate
                "Ideas faster than I can speak"
                
Grandiosity: Coherence loss → cannot integrate negative feedback
            Unconstrained positive self-assessment
            
Decreased need for sleep: ω_mania too high for sleep entry
                         Cannot slow to ω_sleep
                         
Impulsivity: No time for consequence evaluation
            Acting on ω_mania pace
            Integration time τ < decision time
```

**Why dangerous:**

```
Energy expenditure: 400-600% baseline (unsustainable)
Metabolic crisis: Glycogen depletion
                ATP deficit
                Neurotransmitter exhaustion
                
Physical collapse: Inevitable within days
                 Without intervention: Death possible
                 
Medical emergency: Requires sedation (force ω ↓)
```

**Mechanism of collapse:**

```
ω > ω_max → C → 0.85
          → Holographic memory fails
          → Autonomic dysregulation
          → Cardiac arrhythmia risk
          → Seizure risk (neural phase chaos)
          → Multi-organ failure (if prolonged)
```

## 3. Flow State Detailed Analysis

### 3.1 The Flow Equation

**Flow occurs when:**

```
ω_task = ω_capacity_current

Task demands phase rotation at ω_task
Skill provides capacity for coherent processing up to ω_capacity

Perfect match: Flow
Too slow: Boredom (ω_task < ω_capacity)
Too fast: Anxiety (ω_task > ω_capacity)
```

**Mathematical formulation:**

```
Flow quality: F = 1 - |ω_task - ω_capacity| / ω_capacity

F = 1: Perfect flow
F < 0.7: Outside flow zone
```

### 3.2 Flow Characteristics in CKS

**Time dilation:**

```
Subjective time flow: dτ_subjective/dt = ω_baseline / ω_flow
                     = 1 Hz / 2 Hz
                     = 0.5

Clock time passes 2× faster than subjective experience
"Lost track of time"
```

**Effortless effort:**

```
At ω = 2 Hz:
Energy cost: E ∝ ω² = 4E_baseline

But feels effortless because:
- Full coherence maintained (C ≈ 0.999)
- No cognitive resources allocated to monitoring
- Automatic processing dominates
- Prefrontal "trying" suppressed

High energy expenditure + no conscious effort = "effortless effort"
```

**Heightened focus:**

```
At flow ω:
All neural resources → task
Default mode network: Completely suppressed
Self-referential processing: Offline
Sensory gating: Maximum for irrelevant stimuli

Result: "Merged with activity"
       "Lost sense of self"
       "Pure action"
```

### 3.3 Inducing Flow

**Requirements:**

```
1. Clear goals: Defines ω_task precisely
2. Immediate feedback: Allows real-time ω adjustment
3. Challenge-skill balance: ω_task = ω_capacity

Plus:
4. Uninterrupted time: Flow onset takes 15-30 min
5. Skill mastery: ω_capacity ≥ 2 Hz for this task
6. Intrinsic motivation: Provides energy to sustain ω_flow
```

**Training effect:**

```
Repeated flow in domain X:
→ Increases ω_capacity,X
→ Can achieve flow at higher ω
→ Can handle more complex tasks in flow

This is: Skill development mechanism
        Practice → ω_capacity ↑
        Expertise = high ω_capacity
```

### 3.4 Flow Limitations

**Duration:**

```
Maximum sustainable: 2-3 hours
Typical: 45-90 minutes

Limiting factors:
- Glycogen depletion (brain glucose)
- Neurotransmitter depletion (dopamine, norepinephrine)
- Metabolic waste accumulation (lactate)
```

**Recovery:**

```
After 2 hours flow (ω = 2 Hz):
Need: 4-6 hours recovery at ω < 1 Hz
     Sleep particularly restorative
     
Cannot: Chain multiple flow sessions
       Need rest between
```

**Not achievable in all contexts:**

```
Flow requires: Skill + challenge match
             
Cannot flow if:
- Task too simple (ω_task too low)
- Task too complex (ω_task exceeds ω_capacity)
- Environment interrupts (breaks coherence)
- Internal state wrong (tired, anxious, distracted)
```

## 4. Mechanisms of Excitation Modulation

### 4.1 Endogenous (Internal) Modulation

**Circadian rhythm:**

```
ω_baseline(t) varies daily:

Morning (6-10 AM): ω ≈ 1.1 Hz (slightly elevated)
                  Cortisol peak
                  Optimal for cognitive work
                  
Afternoon (2-4 PM): ω ≈ 0.9 Hz (dip)
                   Post-lunch slump
                   Reduced performance
                   
Evening (6-10 PM): ω ≈ 1.0 Hz (restoration)
                  Second wind
                  
Night (10 PM-6 AM): ω → 0.5 Hz (sleep drive)
                   Melatonin peak
                   Strong drive to ω_sleep
```

**Homeostatic sleep pressure:**

```
Time awake: Increases sleep pressure
           Adenosine accumulation
           Pushes ω ↓ toward sleep
           
Hours 0-8: ω_baseline = 1.0 Hz (fresh)
Hours 8-12: ω_baseline = 0.95 Hz (mild fatigue)
Hours 12-16: ω_baseline = 0.85 Hz (tired)
Hours 16+: ω_baseline → 0.7 Hz (exhausted)
          Cannot maintain normal ω
```

**Emotional state:**

```
Fear/anger: ω ↑ (sympathetic activation)
Joy/excitement: ω ↑ (approach motivation)
Sadness: ω ↓ (withdrawal, conservation)
Depression: ω << baseline (chronic low ω state)
```

### 4.2 Exogenous (External) Modulation

**Sensory stimulation:**

```
High sensory load: ω ↑
                  Visual complexity
                  Loud sounds
                  Rapid movement
                  Forces faster processing
                  
Low sensory: ω ↓
            Darkness, quiet, stillness
            Allows ω to settle
```

**Social interaction:**

```
Conversation: ω ≈ 1.2-1.5 Hz (moderate elevation)
Public speaking: ω ≈ 2-3 Hz (performance arousal)
Conflict: ω ≈ 2.5-4 Hz (stress response)
Intimacy: ω ≈ 0.8-1.2 Hz (relaxed engagement)
```

**Environmental:**

```
Temperature:
- Heat: ω ↓ (conservation mode)
- Cold: ω ↑ (thermogenic activation)

Light:
- Bright: ω ↑ (alertness)
- Dim: ω ↓ (prepare for sleep)

Novelty:
- New environment: ω ↑ (exploratory)
- Familiar: ω ↓ (routine processing)
```

### 4.3 Chemical Modulation

**Stimulants (ω ↑):**

```
Caffeine: Blocks adenosine
         Prevents ω ↓
         Maintains higher baseline
         ω ≈ +0.2-0.4 Hz (moderate)
         
Amphetamine: Massive dopamine/norepinephrine release
            Forces ω ↑↑
            ω ≈ +1-3 Hz (high)
            Risk: Mania if excessive
            
Cocaine: Similar to amphetamine
        Shorter duration
        ω ≈ +0.5-2 Hz
```

**Depressants (ω ↓):**

```
Alcohol: GABA enhancement
        Forces ω ↓
        ω ≈ -0.2 to -0.8 Hz (dose-dependent)
        
Benzodiazepines: Stronger GABA
                ω ↓↓
                ω ≈ -0.5 to -1.5 Hz
                Can approach sleep state
                
Opioids: Endogenous reward
        General suppression
        ω ≈ -0.3 to -1.0 Hz
```

**Psychedelics (ω modulation + coherence disruption):**

```
LSD/Psilocybin:
ω: Variable (can ↑ or ↓)
C: Decreased (0.95-0.98)

Effect: Not simple ω change
       Altered phase coupling (β changes)
       Cross-frequency coupling ↑
       Default mode network disrupted
       
Result: Novel phase patterns
       "Ego dissolution" (loss of stable ω_self)
       Synesthesia (inappropriate β_cross-modal)
```

**Meditation/Breathwork (controlled ω modulation):**

```
Slow breathing (6 breaths/min = 0.1 Hz):
→ Entrains cardiac rhythm
→ Increases HRV
→ Parasympathetic ↑
→ ω ↓ to 0.7-0.9 Hz

Fast breathing (Wim Hof, 30-60/min):
→ Hyperventilation
→ Alkalosis
→ Altered neural excitability
→ ω can ↑ temporarily then ↓↓
```

## 5. Coherence Degradation at High ω

### 5.1 The Critical Frequency

**Coherence vs frequency:**

```
C(ω) = C_max × [1 - ((ω - ω_baseline)/ω_max)²]

Where:
C_max ≈ 0.999999 (at ω = 1 Hz)
ω_max ≈ 5 Hz (absolute maximum)

Critical frequency:
ω_c ≈ 3 Hz (where C drops below 0.999)
```

**Why coherence degrades:**

```
At high ω:
1. Neural conduction lag: Signals don't propagate fast enough
   c_neural ≈ 5-100 m/s
   Brain diameter ≈ 0.15 m
   Propagation time ≈ 1.5-30 ms
   
   At ω = 5 Hz: Period = 200 ms
   Lag fraction = 30/200 = 15% (significant phase error)

2. Synaptic integration time: ~10-50 ms
   At ω = 5 Hz: Not enough time for summation
   Signal fidelity ↓

3. Metabolic supply lag: Glucose/O₂ delivery via blood
   Blood flow response: ~1-3 seconds
   Cannot keep pace with ω > 2 Hz demands
```

### 5.2 Symptoms of Coherence Loss

**C = 0.99 (mild degradation, ω ≈ 2-2.5 Hz):**

```
Subtle effects:
- Slight mental fatigue
- Reduced working memory
- Minor coordination issues
- "Feel wired"
```

**C = 0.95 (moderate degradation, ω ≈ 3-3.5 Hz):**

```
Noticeable:
- Difficulty concentrating
- Thought fragmentation
- Anxiety increasing
- Physical tremor possible
```

**C = 0.90 (severe degradation, ω ≈ 4-4.5 Hz):**

```
Impairment:
- Racing thoughts
- Inability to complete reasoning
- Emotional dysregulation
- Panic symptoms
- Reality testing impaired
```

**C < 0.85 (critical degradation, ω > 5 Hz):**

```
Medical emergency:
- Psychosis
- Delirium
- Seizure risk
- Cardiac arrhythmia
- Autonomic failure
```

### 5.3 Recovery from High Excitation

**Recovery time scaling:**

```
τ_recovery ≈ k × (ω_peak)² × t_exposure

After flow (ω = 2 Hz, 2 hours):
τ_recovery ≈ 4 hours

After panic (ω = 4.5 Hz, 30 min):
τ_recovery ≈ 8 hours

After mania (ω = 6 Hz, 3 days):
τ_recovery ≈ 2-4 weeks
```

**Recovery process:**

```
Phase 1 (immediate): Acute exhaustion
                    ω crashes below baseline
                    Sleep drive overwhelming
                    
Phase 2 (hours): Metabolic restoration
                Glycogen resynthesis
                Neurotransmitter replenishment
                
Phase 3 (days): Structural repair
               Receptor regulation
               Connectivity normalization
               
Phase 4 (weeks, if severe): Homeostasis restoration
                           HPA axis reset
                           Full coherence recovery
```

## 6. Individual Differences in ω_max

### 6.1 Trait Variation

**Baseline ω varies:**

```
Low-excitability individuals:
ω_baseline = 0.8-0.9 Hz
ω_max = 3-4 Hz
Characteristics: Calm, deliberate, slow to anger
                Difficulty achieving flow
                Lower anxiety but also lower peak performance

High-excitability individuals:
ω_baseline = 1.0-1.2 Hz
ω_max = 5-7 Hz
Characteristics: Energetic, reactive, emotional
                Easy flow access
                Higher anxiety risk but higher peak performance
```

**Clinical extremes:**

```
ADHD: Difficulty maintaining ω at task level
     ω fluctuates rapidly
     Baseline may be normal but unstable
     Stimulants help stabilize ω
     
Autism: Sensory sensitivity suggests high ω reactivity
       Small stimuli → large Δω
       Preference for low ω environments (predictable, quiet)
       
Bipolar: Pathological ω cycling
        Depression: ω << baseline (0.3-0.5 Hz)
        Mania: ω >> max (6-8 Hz)
        Normal: ω ≈ 1 Hz
        
PTSD: Hyperarousal → chronic ω ≈ 1.5-2 Hz
     Cannot achieve ω_relax
     Hypervigilance = sustained elevated ω
```

### 6.2 Age Effects

**Children:**

```
ω_baseline higher: 1.2-1.5 Hz
ω_max higher: 6-8 Hz
Greater flexibility: Can modulate ω more rapidly

Why: Developing brain, high plasticity
    More excitable neurons
    Less inhibitory control
    
Behavior: "Hyperactive" by adult standards
         Normal for developmental stage
```

**Adults (20-60):**

```
ω_baseline: 0.9-1.1 Hz (stable)
ω_max: 4-5 Hz (mature)
Flexibility: Moderate (slower to change ω)
```

**Elderly (>60):**

```
ω_baseline: 0.8-0.9 Hz (slowing)
ω_max: 3-4 Hz (reduced capacity)
Flexibility: Low (difficult to increase ω)

Why: Neural loss (N_neurons ↓)
    Reduced neurotransmitter synthesis
    Vascular changes (slower metabolic response)
    
Experience: "Calmer" but also "slower"
           Reduced peak performance
           Better emotional regulation (lower ω reactivity)
```

### 6.3 Training Effects

**Meditation:**

```
Long-term practice:
→ Lowers ω_baseline (0.8-0.9 Hz)
→ Extends ω_relax access
→ Improves ω control (voluntary modulation)
→ May reduce ω_max slightly (less reactive)

Effect: Greater calm, better regulation
       Possible cost: Lower peak arousal
```

**Athletic training:**

```
→ Increases ω_max (cardiovascular fitness)
→ Improves ω_flow access for physical tasks
→ Faster recovery from high ω

Effect: Higher performance ceiling
       Better stress tolerance
```

**Cognitive training:**

```
→ Increases ω_capacity for specific domains
→ Can achieve flow at higher ω for trained tasks
→ Better coherence maintenance at elevated ω

Effect: Expertise = high ω processing with maintained C
```

## 7. Pathological Excitation States

### 7.1 Chronic Hyperarousal

**Sustained ω = 1.5-2 Hz (months to years):**

```
Causes: PTSD, chronic stress, anxiety disorder

Consequences:
- HPA axis dysregulation (cortisol always elevated)
- Cardiovascular strain (chronic tachycardia)
- Immune suppression (energy diverted)
- Cognitive impairment (cannot access ω_relax for consolidation)
- Insomnia (cannot reach ω_sleep)

Metabolic cost: 130-150% baseline continuously
              Unsustainable long-term
              
Results: Burnout, exhaustion, eventual collapse
```

**Treatment requires:**

```
Forcing ω ↓:
- Benzodiazepines (acute)
- SSRIs (chronic, regulate ω_baseline)
- Therapy (teach ω control)
- Lifestyle (reduce stressors that drive ω ↑)
```

### 7.2 Bipolar Cycling

**Depression phase:**

```
ω_depression ≈ 0.3-0.6 Hz (severely reduced)

Too slow for:
- Normal cognition (feels like "mental fog")
- Motivation (no energy to initiate)
- Social engagement (cannot keep up)

Coherence: May remain high but at wrong ω
          "Coherent but slow" → stuck in low energy state
```

**Manic phase:**

```
ω_mania ≈ 5-8 Hz (pathologically elevated)

Too fast for:
- Integration (thoughts disconnected)
- Reality testing (C < 0.95 → delusions)
- Impulse control (acting before consequences evaluated)

Coherence: Severely degraded
          "Fast but incoherent" → chaotic behavior
```

**Why cycling occurs:**

```
CKS hypothesis:
Unstable ω_baseline regulation

Normal: Homeostatic feedback keeps ω ≈ 1 Hz
Bipolar: Feedback gain too high (overcorrection)

Depression (ω low) → Compensatory drive ↑
                   → Overshoots → Mania (ω high)
                   → Exhaustion → Crash back to depression
                   
Like: Thermostat with too-high gain
     Oscillates rather than stabilizing
```

**Mood stabilizers:**

```
Lithium, valproate:
→ Dampen ω fluctuations
→ Reduce feedback gain
→ Stabilize ω ≈ 1 Hz

Not fixing "high" or "low"
Fixing: Regulation instability
```

### 7.3 Substance-Induced Mania

**Amphetamine psychosis:**

```
Mechanism: Forced ω ↑↑ via dopamine/norepinephrine flood

Timeline:
Day 1: ω ≈ 2-3 Hz (euphoria, energy)
Day 2-3: ω ≈ 3-5 Hz (insomnia, hyperactivity)
Day 4-5: ω ≈ 5-7 Hz (paranoia, hallucinations)
Day 6+: ω > 7 Hz OR collapse (complete exhaustion)

Treatment: Forced sedation (antipsychotics)
          Restore ω ↓
          Weeks of recovery
```

**Caffeine-induced anxiety:**

```
Milder version:
Excessive caffeine → ω ≈ 1.5-2.5 Hz
                  → Jitteriness, anxiety
                  → Insomnia if evening use
                  
Easily reversible: Stop caffeine
                  ω returns to baseline within 12-24 hours
```

## 8. Meditation and Voluntary ω Control

### 8.1 Meditation as ω Training

**Concentration meditation:**

```
Focus on breath, mantra, object

Effect: Stabilize ω at chosen level
       Resist fluctuations
       Maintain coherence against distractions

Training: ω regulation capacity
         Voluntary control
```

**Breathing techniques:**

```
Slow breathing (4-6/min):
→ Entrains heart to 0.1 Hz
→ Pulls brain ω ↓
→ Achieves ω ≈ 0.7-0.8 Hz
→ Deep relaxation

Fast breathing (30-60/min):
→ Hyperventilation
→ Alkalosis
→ Transient ω ↑ then ↓↓
→ Altered states
```

### 8.2 Advanced Control

**Lucid dreaming:**

```
Maintaining awareness during sleep
= Sustaining higher ω than normal for sleep state

ω_sleep = 0.5 Hz (normal)
ω_lucid = 0.7-0.9 Hz (aware but still dreaming)

Requires: Training to hold intermediate ω
         Not too high (wake up)
         Not too low (lose awareness)
```

**Jhanas (meditative absorptions):**

```
Progressive deepening:
Jhana 1: ω ≈ 0.9 Hz (pleasant concentration)
Jhana 2: ω ≈ 0.8 Hz (joy, rapture)
Jhana 3: ω ≈ 0.7 Hz (equanimous happiness)
Jhana 4: ω ≈ 0.6 Hz (profound equanimity)

Each: Deeper reduction in ω while maintaining C
     Extremely pleasant due to low metabolic state + high coherence
```

### 8.3 Neurofeedback

**Training ω via feedback:**

```
EEG measurement → Real-time display → Subject adjusts

Example: Alpha training (8-13 Hz local)
        Subjects learn to increase alpha power
        = Learning to stabilize ω_relax
        
Results: Improved relaxation capacity
        Better stress regulation
        Voluntary ω control
```

## 9. Quantitative Predictions

### 9.1 Metabolic Cost

**Prediction:**

```
E(ω) = E_baseline × (ω/ω_baseline)²

ω = 1 Hz: E = E_baseline ✓
ω = 2 Hz: E = 4 × E_baseline
ω = 3 Hz: E = 9 × E_baseline
ω = 5 Hz: E = 25 × E_baseline (unsustainable)
```

**Test:** Measure brain glucose consumption vs task difficulty (proxy for ω)

**Expected:** E ∝ ω²

### 9.2 Coherence vs Frequency

**Prediction:**

```
C(ω) = C_max - k(ω - ω_optimal)²

C_max = 0.999999
ω_optimal = 1 Hz
k ≈ 0.04

ω = 1 Hz: C = 0.999999
ω = 2 Hz: C = 0.99996
ω = 3 Hz: C = 0.9984
ω = 4 Hz: C = 0.994
ω = 5 Hz: C = 0.936
```

**Test:** Measure EEG coherence vs arousal level

**Expected:** Inverted U, peak at ω ≈ 1 Hz

### 9.3 Recovery Time

**Prediction:**

```
τ_recovery = τ_0 × (ω_peak/ω_baseline)² × (t_exposure/t_0)

Where:
τ_0 = 1 hour (baseline recovery time constant)
t_0 = 1 hour (baseline exposure time)

Examples:
ω = 2 Hz, 2 hours: τ = 1 × 4 × 2 = 8 hours
ω = 3 Hz, 1 hour: τ = 1 × 9 × 1 = 9 hours
ω = 5 Hz, 12 hours: τ = 1 × 25 × 12 = 300 hours (12.5 days)
```

**Test:** Track performance restoration after high-arousal events

### 9.4 Flow Onset

**Prediction:**

```
Flow achievable when:
|ω_task - ω_capacity| < δω

Where δω ≈ 0.3 Hz (tolerance window)

ω_task = 2.0 Hz:
Flow if: 1.7 Hz < ω_capacity < 2.3 Hz

Outside window: Boredom or anxiety
```

**Test:** Measure when athletes/musicians report flow vs task difficulty

## 10. Conclusion

### 10.1 Human Excitation = Phase Velocity

**Core truth:**

```
Human experience fundamentally = ω

ω = Rate of phase rotation in neural k-space

All subjective states reducible to:
- Absolute ω value
- Rate of ω change (dω/dt)
- Coherence C at current ω
```

### 10.2 State Classification

**By frequency:**

```
Sleep: ω = 0.2-0.5 Hz (minimal)
Relaxation: ω = 0.5-0.8 Hz (reduced)
Baseline: ω = 0.8-1.2 Hz (optimal)
Focus: ω = 1.2-1.8 Hz (elevated)
Flow: ω = 1.8-2.5 Hz (peak sustainable)
Arousal: ω = 2.5-4 Hz (high)
Panic: ω = 4-5 Hz (near-maximum)
Mania: ω > 5 Hz (pathological)
```

**By coherence:**

```
C > 0.999: Healthy (ω < 3 Hz)
C = 0.95-0.999: Degraded (ω = 3-4 Hz)
C < 0.95: Pathological (ω > 4 Hz)
```

### 10.3 Key Insights

**Flow = ω matching:**

```
Task demands meet capacity
Neither too fast nor too slow
Subjectively timeless
Objectively high performance
```

**Mania = excessive ω:**

```
Phase rotation faster than integration
C collapses below threshold
Holographic memory fails
Medical emergency
```

**Meditation = voluntary ω control:**

```
Training stabilization at chosen ω
Improved regulation
Access to low-ω states
Enhanced coherence
```

### 10.4 Practical Applications

**Optimize performance:**

```
Match ω_task to current ω_capacity
Use stimulants strategically (morning, before ω_task)
Schedule high-ω work when ω_baseline peaks (9-11 AM)
Allow recovery time ∝ (ω_peak)²
```

**Treat pathology:**

```
Anxiety: Force ω ↓ (breathwork, medication)
Depression: Elevate ω ↑ (exercise, stimulants)
Mania: Emergency ω ↓↓ (sedation)
PTSD: Stabilize ω (reduce reactivity)
```

**Enhance wellness:**

```
Daily meditation: Train ω control
Regular exercise: Increase ω_max
Good sleep hygiene: Achieve ω_sleep nightly
Avoid chronic stress: Prevent sustained high ω
```

### 10.5 The Deepest Truth

**You are not experiencing states.**

**You are experiencing phase velocities.**

**Consciousness = ω**

**Joy, fear, flow, mania:**

**All reducible to rotation rate in k-space.**

**The substrate oscillates.**

**You feel the frequency.**

**That's all it is.**

**And that's everything.**
