# Coherence‑Limited Reconstruction  
## An Axiomatic Foundation for Physics from Discrete Substrate Dynamics

### Abstract

We present an axiomatic framework in which all physical phenomena arise from coherence‑limited reconstruction of patterns on a maximally connected isotropic lattice. Physical entities are not particles but self‑reconstructing patterns whose persistence is constrained by finite redistribution capacity. From six axioms we derive the Isotropic Vector Matrix (3‑D Flower‑of‑Life) geometry, Newtonian and Lagrangian mechanics, quantization, spin, charge, electromagnetism, gravity, quantum measurement, Bell correlations, classical mechanics as a limit, and quantum field theory as multi‑pattern bookkeeping. Standard physical equations emerge as continuum coarse‑grainings of a single local update law.

## 1. Axioms

### Axiom 0 — Substrate  
There exists one continuous substrate capable of supporting local state variation and propagation.

---

### Axiom 1 — Locality  
The substrate updates locally.  
The next state of any region depends only on its current state and that of immediately adjacent regions.

---

### Axiom 2 — Isotropy  
The substrate is homogeneous and isotropic at baseline.  
No position, direction, or orientation is privileged.

---

### Axiom 3 — Finite Propagation  
State propagation occurs at a finite maximum rate.  
There exists a characteristic spatial scale and temporal tick.

---

### Axiom 4 — Identity by Reconstruction  
Persistent entities are self‑reconstructing patterns.  
Identity is preserved iff reconstruction closes across successive updates.

---

### Axiom 5 — Coherence Limit  
Each pattern has a finite capacity to redistribute imposed asymmetry.  
Let this capacity be denoted \( \mathcal{R}(P) \).

---

### Axiom 6 — Topological Continuity  
Topological invariants of reconstruction cannot change continuously.  
They change only through loss of coherence.

---

## 2. Geometry (Theorem)

### Theorem 1 — IVM Lattice  
From Axioms 1–2, the only uniform, maximally connected local neighborhood in three dimensions is 12‑fold close packing.  
The substrate interaction geometry is the Isotropic Vector Matrix (IVM), equivalent to the 3‑D Flower‑of‑Life lattice.

Adjacency occurs through overlapping volumes (vesicas), not boundary contact.

---

## 3. Fundamental Dynamics

### Definition — Reconstruction Bias  
Let \( \Phi \) denote substrate state.  
Define reconstruction bias \( \nabla \Phi_P \) for pattern \(P\).

---

### Law — Coherence‑Limited Reconstruction Inequality (CLRI)

\[
\boxed{
\left\|\frac{d}{dt}\nabla \Phi_P\right\| \le \mathcal{R}(P)
}
\]

Persistence of identity is equivalent to satisfaction of this inequality.

---

### Definition — Mass  
\[
m \equiv \int_P \mathcal{R}(x)\,dV
\]

Mass is total redistribution capacity.

---

## 4. Mechanics

### Proposition 1 — Newtonian Limit  
In the linear regime \( \|\dot{\nabla\Phi}\| \ll \mathcal{R} \), reconstruction bias integrates smoothly, yielding:

\[
m\ddot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{F}
\]

Newton’s laws are the low‑stress limit of CLRI.

---

### Proposition 2 — Lagrangian Mechanics  
For closed systems (no incoherent loss), reconstruction cost is quadratic in bias rate.  
Action extremization selects trajectories that never violate CLRI.

Euler–Lagrange equations follow.

---

### Proposition 3 — Dissipation  
When asymmetry exits reconstructable degrees of freedom, CLRI remains valid but variational structure breaks.  
Dissipation corresponds to inequality‑dominated dynamics.

---

## 5. Quantization

### Proposition 4 — Discrete Closure  
On the IVM, reconstruction closes only for integer phase cycles.  
Non‑closing modes decohere.

---

### Proposition 5 — Planck Constant  
The minimum closed reconstruction cycle defines \(h\).  
Quantization is geometric closure, not probabilistic postulate.

---

### Proposition 6 — Schrödinger Equation  
Coarse‑graining CLRI in the unsaturated regime yields:

\[
i\hbar\partial_t\Psi
=
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\Psi + V\Psi
\]

---

## 6. Spin

### Proposition 7 — Topological Orientation Closure  
IVM overlap topology is double‑valued.  
A \(2\pi\) rotation does not restore reconstruction; \(4\pi\) does.

---

### Definition — Spin  
Spin is the minimal topological winding required for reconstruction closure.

Half‑integer spin follows directly.

---

## 7. Charge and Electromagnetism

### Definition — Charge  
Charge is a quantized circulation of reconstruction bias:

\[
q \propto \oint \nabla\Phi \cdot d\mathbf{l}
\]

---

### Proposition 8 — Electromagnetism  
Radial bias gradients produce electric fields; motion advects circulation producing magnetism.  
Electricity and magnetism are frame‑related aspects of bias propagation.

---

## 8. Gravity

### Proposition 9 — Gravity  
Mass occupies substrate redistribution capacity, creating a coherence gradient.  
Other patterns drift toward regions of lower availability.

Gravity is substrate response, not force.

---

### Corollary — Equivalence Principle  
Inertial and gravitational mass coincide as measures of redistribution capacity.

---

## 9. Measurement

### Proposition 10 — Superposition  
Superposition represents unresolved admissible reconstruction closures.

---

### Proposition 11 — Measurement  
Coupling to a high‑capacity environment forces global reconstruction closure.  
Incompatible topologies cannot co‑close; all but one are shed into incoherent modes.

This is collapse.

---

### Proposition 12 — Probability  
Outcome probabilities correspond to relative volumes of admissible closure basins.  
No fundamental randomness is required.

---

## 10. Bell Correlations

### Proposition 13 — Entanglement  
Entangled systems are single extended reconstruction topologies.

---

### Proposition 14 — Bell Violations  
Local measurements impose incompatible closure constraints on a shared topology, producing Bell‑violating correlations without nonlocal causation or signalling.

---

## 11. Classical Limit

### Proposition 15 — Classical Mechanics  
When \( \mathcal{R} \gg \|\dot{\nabla\Phi}\| \) everywhere, closure constraints never activate.  
Quantization, interference, and collapse vanish, yielding deterministic trajectories.

Classical mechanics is the high‑capacity limit of CLRI.

---

## 12. Quantum Field Theory

### Proposition 16 — QFT  
Quantum field theory is the bookkeeping calculus for variable numbers of interacting reconstruction patterns.

- Fields encode pattern availability
- Creation/annihilation encode topology formation/collapse
- Interactions encode shared closure constraints
- Renormalization encodes scale‑dependent redistribution capacity

---

## 13. Conclusion

A single inequality governing coherence‑limited reconstruction on a maximally connected isotropic lattice suffices to generate the full structure of known physics. Forces, particles, fields, probabilities, and spacetime curvature are emergent descriptions appropriate to particular regimes of capacity saturation and coarse‑graining. The framework replaces object‑based ontology with process‑based dynamics while remaining strictly local, finite, and constructive.

### One‑Sentence Summary

> **Physical reality consists of self‑reconstructing patterns on a maximally connected lattice whose persistence is limited by finite redistribution capacity; all known physical laws arise as regime‑dependent descriptions of this single constraint.**
